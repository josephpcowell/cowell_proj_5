   "lyrics": "[Verse]\nMy friend came to me\nWith sadness in his eyes\nHe told me that he wanted help\nBefore his country dies\nAlthough I couldn't feel the pain\nI knew I had to try\nNow I'm asking all of you\nTo help us save some lives\n\n[Chorus]\nBangladesh, Bangladesh\nWhere so many people are dying fast\nAnd it sure looks like a mess\nI've never seen such distress\nNow won't you lend your hand and understand?\nRelieve the people of Bangladesh\n\n[Chorus]\nBangladesh, Bangladesh\nSuch a great disaster, I don't understand\nBut it sure looks like a mess\nI've never known such distress\nNow please don't turn away\nI want to hear you say\nRelieve the people of Bangladesh\nRelieve Bangladesh\n\n[Chorus]\nBangladesh, Bangladesh\nNow it may seem so far from where we all are\nIt's something we can't reject\nIt's something I can't neglect\nNow won't you give some bread? Get the starving fed?\n\n[Outro]\nWe've got to relieve Bangladesh\nRelieve the people of Bangladesh\nWe've got to relieve Bangladesh\nRelieve the people of Bangladesh"

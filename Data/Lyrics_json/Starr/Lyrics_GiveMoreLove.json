(so wrong) For so long (for so long)\nHow could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)\nHow could I (How could I) be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)\n\nAll the time we spent together so close and true\nLiving for each other together thru the blue (thru the blue)\nTwo stars like lovers beneath the Tennessee moon\nWe near as we could be\nJohnny Cash and June\n\nHow could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)\nHow could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long\nHow could I (How could I) be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (for so long)\nFor so long (for so long)\nFor so long\n\nThen I heard a rumor, from an old friend of mine\nHe been seeing someone else, I never saw the signs\nI hope he make she happy, and that he is happy too\nAnd just like all the others, I'll get over you\n\nBut how could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)\nHow could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (so long)\nHow could I (How could I) be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (so long)\nHow could I\u2026 be so wrong? For so Long"

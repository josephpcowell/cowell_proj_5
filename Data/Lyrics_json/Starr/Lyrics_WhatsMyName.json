(Ringo!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSpinning 'round and 'round\nWe broke the speed of sound\nTearin' up the freeway\nWith the tumblin' of the dice\nAnd gettin' bad advice\nWe had to call a mayday\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey said we've had the last\nWe're a thing of the past\nBut I can still rock 'n' roll\nYou can't deny\nWe're doin' somethin' right\nIt's not my first rodeo\n\n[Chorus]\nNothin' stays the same\nBut I'm still in the game\nWhat's my name? (Ringo!)\n\n[Bridge]\nI can't get enough\nOf peace and love\nThis is what I've come to understand\nI'll pull myself together\nThrough all kinds of weather\nI'll give you everything I can\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, I've seen it all\nFrom the mountains of Nepal\nTo Reno, Nevada\nI've taken all the falls\nI was climbin' up the walls\nAnd now it doesn't matter\n\n[Chorus]\nNothin' stays the same\nBut I'm still in the game\nWhat's my name? (Ringo!)\n\n[Outro]\nNow I'm playing on the run\nAnd there is only one\nWhat's my name? (Ringo!)\nI can feel the love\nFrom the stars above\nWhat's my name? (Ringo!)\n\nFollowin' the sun\nWhere the river runs\nWhat's my name? (Ringo!)\nNow I've raised my hands\nAll across the lands\nWhat's my name? (Ringo!)\n\nNothin' stays the same\nBut I'm still in the game\nNothin' stays the same\nBut I'm still in the game\nNothin' stays the same\nBut I'm still in the game\nHey, what's my name?

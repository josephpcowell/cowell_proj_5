(the way of knowing)\nHow do we make it last? (just keep on growing)\n\n[Verse 3]\nTomorrow is a yesterday\n'Cause nothing ever goes away\nThe love that is living inside you\nWill guide you forever\n\n[Chorus]\nMusic played this way\nAll I need is my imagination\nTake me far away\nWhere I can be with everyone who loves me\nLet me be with everyone who loves me"

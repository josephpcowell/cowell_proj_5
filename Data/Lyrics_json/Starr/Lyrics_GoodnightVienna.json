(Keep it up)\nGet it up! (Keep it up)\nGet it up! (Keep it up)\nGet it up! (Keep it up)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI took my baby to a party last night, ah-hah-hah\nShe was so beautiful, she made me uptight, ah-hah-hah\nUp came a butcher with his needles in sight, ah-hah-hah\nIt's all down to goodnight Vienna"

(watch them land)\nI'm standing all by myself\nAin't got nobody else\nAll by myself\nI don't need nobody\nI work out my problems\nI'm starting all over again\nI just started smiling\nI'm making myself some new friends\n(don't you know I've got?)\nI've got a brand new feeling\nI just can't hide. (just can't hide)\nI'm standing all by myself\nAin't got nobody else, (to turn to)\nAll by myself\nI don't need nobody\nWay back in my memory\nI can see where I've wasted my time\nYou came and took what you wanted\nAnd then tried to take what was mine\n(well, don't you know I'm tired)\nI'm tired of finding myself\nUp against the wall, it's so tall\nI'm standing all by myself\nAin't got nobody else, (to turn to)\nAll by myself\nI ain't got nobody\n\n[Chorus][x2]\n(I'm standing) all by myself\nAin't got nobody else, (nobody)\nAll by myself\nI ain't got nobody\n(ooh, ooh, ooh)"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSix o'clock in the morning, you've just gone to sleep\nI wipe a tear from my eye\nIt can't be the kind of company I keep\nThat keeps me asking, you keep me asking\nYou keep me wondering why\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt could be the comfort going to my head\nThat makes me want to dream of you\nBut while you're sleeping softly in your bed\nI want to tell you, I'd like to tell you\nI'd love to tell you too\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n[Verse 3]\nI know you would say, you love my way\nIt's good enough for you\nBut i know for sure, I could do more, (more) more. (more)\nI want to tell you, I'd like to tell you\nI'd love to tell you too\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't treat you like I'd like to treat you\nEvery planet in the sky is in your eyes\nBut I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I\nNo, I don't treat you like I should"

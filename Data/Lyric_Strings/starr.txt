In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Full steam ahead, Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye

What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?They're gonna put me in the movies

Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club BandI’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe (Happy and they’re safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you

Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you

Ah, there's music in the streets
And there's music in the air
A little old soul beat
And there's dancing everywhere
I would tell the whole world
Tell them if I could
To add a little song into each life
Oh, it's a-finger snapping good
Oh! Oh!
Ah, pardon me, boys, but could you use it?
We're gonna make a little music
You got soul, now don't you lose it
We're gonna make a little music
Everything's gonna be mellow
We got just a-singing occapella
Everything's gonna be mellow

Everybody singing occapellaEver since I met you, baby
I've been acting kinda strange
I wake up in the morning
Then without a warning
All I do is scream your name, yeh
Every time I look inside me
I see the man that I've become
You make me want to huller
And jump right out my collar
You've got me on the run, yeh
Oo-wee, babe, oo-wee, yeh
Friends don't recognise me
They say you hypnotise me
Oo, what you done to me, babe?
You drive me out of my sunsets, oo-wee
She look just like the new Jean Harlow, (ooohh!)
With sultry lips and long blonde hair
They say she came from haites
Or was it the Euphrates
That brought my lady here, yeh?
Oo-wee, babe, oo-wee, yeh
Friends don't understand me
They say you underhand me
Oo, what you done to me, babe?
You drive me out of my senses, oo-wee
When I walk into her parlour
It's like the spider and the fly
In the darkness she surrounds me
And weaves her web around me
And locks me up inside, yeh
She look just like the new Jean Harlow, (ooohh!)
With sultry lips and long blonde hair
They say she came from haites
Or was it the Euphrates
That brought my lady here, yeh?
Oo-wee, babe, oo-wee, yeh
Friends don't understand me
They say you underhand me
Oo, what you done to me, babe?
You drive me out of my senses, oo-wee
Oo-wee, babe (oo-wee)
Oo-wee, babe (oo-wee)
Oo-wee, babe (oo-wee)Two broken hearts
Lonely looking like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each
Having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the numbers of husbands and wives
Two broken hearts
Lonely looking like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each
Having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the numbers of husbands and wives
A woman and a man, a man and a woman
Some can and some can't, and some can't
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the numbers of husbands and wives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the numbers of husbands and wivesOne, two, three, four!
I was born in the north of England
I was raised in a working town
I broke all the rules when I went to school
But the teacher's couldn't pin me down
I tried to make my parents proud
By adapting to the social powers
Oh, pigs will fly and the earth will fry
When they get me doing honest hours
Snookeroo, snookeroo
Daddy's going on the booze
Mother used to cut my hair
And sister used to make the news
Well, it was two rooms up and two rooms down
We were sentenced by the wrecking crane
Oh, I was born on the eve of Halloween
And snookeroo, snookeroo
Snookeroo's my name
I need someone to cook for me
And turn me lose at night
I could spend my life with a factory girl
'Cause a factory girl's my type
I hear them gossip on the street
Most of what they say is true
Oh, don't you know that I hear them say
"There goes that lazy, no good snookeroo"
Snookeroo, snookeroo
Daddy's going on the booze
Mother used to cut my hair

Snookeroo, snookeroo
Snookeroo, snookeroo
Snookeroo's my name, yeah!I looked out my window
And watched all the people go by
I wonder what happens
And who's taking who for a ride
(don't you know that I'm bound?)
I'm bound to pick up the pieces
And watch them land. (watch them land)
I'm standing all by myself
Ain't got nobody else
All by myself
I don't need nobody
I work out my problems
I'm starting all over again
I just started smiling
I'm making myself some new friends
(don't you know I've got?)
I've got a brand new feeling
I just can't hide. (just can't hide)
I'm standing all by myself
Ain't got nobody else, (to turn to)
All by myself
I don't need nobody
Way back in my memory
I can see where I've wasted my time
You came and took what you wanted
And then tried to take what was mine
(well, don't you know I'm tired)
I'm tired of finding myself
Up against the wall, it's so tall
I'm standing all by myself
Ain't got nobody else, (to turn to)
All by myself
I ain't got nobody
(I'm standing) all by myself
Ain't got nobody else, (nobody)
All by myself

With your love, I'll be strong
With your love, ill be strong and carry on
Don't be hurt by what you've seen, dear
I know it's like a dream, dear
Remember, I slept too
Remember, I slept too with you
It's time that we both went through it
If we don't, then we know we'll blew it
'Cause we've gotta give it a try, (gotta give it, give it a try)
Yeah, we've gotta give it a try, yeah, you and I
We tried, (we know that we tried)
But we didn't make it. (we tried, you know that we tried)

A lady that I know just came from Colombia
She smiled because I did not understand
Then she held out some marijuana, ha ha!
She said it was the best in all the land
And I said
"No, no, no, no, I don't smoke it no more
I'm tired of waking up on the floor
No, thank you, please, it only makes me sneeze
And then it makes it hard to find the door"
(Ah-ah-aye-aye)
A woman that I know just came from Mallorca, Spain
She smiled because I did not understand (Parazzi! Parazzi!) (Olé!)

Only you can make this world seem right
Only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone
Can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you
Only you can make this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand i understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you
Only you
Mm-mm-mm-mmNobody loved her, it was easy to see
That made it easy for me
The boys never fought over her company
That made it easy for me
Love so bright could only blind us
How could reason hope to find us
Hiding in the milky way
Without a star to shine the way?
Sand castles fell from the tears in our eyes
That made it easier to see
Now the dream's over and i realise
That makes it easy for meOk, with gusto, boys, with gusto!

Mexico, you've got to go, you know it just ain't fair-
To get your women back, now hurry because they're all there
You're all alone but you'll make it alright
You'll find your women there
But to get them, you'll have to fight
Six o'clock in the morning, you've just gone to sleep
I wipe a tear from my eye
It can't be the kind of company I keep
That keeps me asking, you keep me asking
You keep me wondering why
I don't treat you like I'd like to treat you
Every planet in the sky is in your eyes
But I don't treat you like I
No, I don't treat you like I
No, I don't treat you like I should
It could be the comfort going to my head
That makes me want to dream of you
But while you're sleeping softly in your bed
I want to tell you, I'd like to tell you
I'd love to tell you too
I don't treat you like I'd like to treat you
Every planet in the sky is in your eyes
But I don't treat you like I
No, I don't treat you like I
No, I don't treat you like I should
I know you would say, you love my way
It's good enough for you
But i know for sure, I could do more, (more) more. (more)
I want to tell you, I'd like to tell you
I'd love to tell you too
I don't treat you like I'd like to treat you
Every planet in the sky is in your eyes
But I don't treat you like I
No, I don't treat you like I

200 miles till we get to London
We were sleeping on the floor
Living on bread and jam
Because we thought we'd hit the big time
We didn't give a damn
We were Rory and the Hurricanes
Rory and the Hurricanes
Rory and the Hurricanes
Rory and the Hurricanes
Rory and the Hurricanes
Went to dance
On a Friday night
Every London girl we asked
Was so uptight
I saw a pretty little girl
She came from France
She said "Oui"
When I asked her to dance
The world was spinning
Like the glitter ball above
...and already I was falling in love
We were Rory and the Hurricanes
Rory and the Hurricanes
We were Rory and the Hurricanes
Going down to 'Soho'
Was the place you had to go
It's where everyone was made
Down to the Two Eye Cafe
That's where Tommy Steele would play
Next time we went to London Town
We didn't (do) much hanging around
I was with you know who
I played the drums like I always do
We were Rory and the Hurricanes
Rory and the Hurricanes
Rory and the Hurricanes
Rory and the HurricanesI woke up this morning and opened up my eyes
I made myself some coffee and then I realized
Some people are good some people are bad
Some people are crazy and some are still so sad
When you're in town
You bring the party down
The times are changing but you don't understand
Still living off your memories when you were in the band
You're loaded up on this you're loaded up on that
Your mind is just so twisted you don't know where you're at
When you make that sound
You bring the party down
I tried to help you time and time again
I thought you'd listen to me your dear old friend
I tried my best I did what I can
You never listened you just don't understand
When you're around
You bring the party down
When you're around
You bring the party downEach and every road is filled with choices
Have to decide which way to go
You can say where are you at
Turn around or go back
Or take a chance on what’s ahead
You never know
Down every road you come to bridges
Some are crossed and some get banned
And some you can get down
And new ones get built from what we learned
Down every road we come to bridges
Crossing bridges is the best way to go
Down every road you come to bridges
Crossing bridges is the best way to go
Come a long way
From where I started
Still got a long way to go
I still got some things that need answers
But this much I know
This much I know
If where are you know isn’t working
Crossing bridges is the best way to go
Crossing bridges is the best way to go
I searched here, there and everywhere
Until I saw you standing there
I am the greatest fan of you
And love is all I've got to do
It's all too much my little child
If you will be my honey pie
Eight days a week you will be mine
And getting better all the time
I'm begging you don't pass me by
And if you do please tell me why
I know you told me yesterday
You've got to hide your love away
But if your honey is bad to me
It told me "love and let it be"
Postcards from Paradise
With all my love and I'll be true
Postcards from Paradise
As ever P.S. I love you
Postcards from Paradise
I would not treat you for no one
I see your face here comes the sun
And I am going nowhere man
Because I want to hold your hand
It's like I said the night before
I'll love you when I'm sixty four
Postcards from Paradise
With all my love and I'll be true
Postcards from Paradise
As ever P.S. I love you
Postcards from Paradise
I know that we can work it out
There ain't no need of twist and shout
And I won't back off boogaloo
Unless you say you love me do
Postcards from Paradise
With all my love and I'll be true
Postcards from Paradise
As ever P.S. I love you
Postcards from Paradise
Postcards from Paradise
With all my love and I'll be true
Postcards from Paradise
As ever P.S. I love you
Postcards from ParadiseBe what you’re doing
Stop what you do
The only one you’re fooling
Isn’t me it’s you
Didn’t I try to tell you?
You carry in a much too heavy note
You’re on the right side of the wrong side of the road
Aiming for disaster
Something’s got to change
You’re only moving faster
Almost out of range
It isn’t about direction
Until you got no place left to go
No ,no,no
Somebody already told me
What I’m telling you
I won’t ask anybody who knows me
I believe you can do it too
Tell me are you open
To be turned around?
You never really too much to be found
Maybe choose another direction
You got so many ways to go
(x2)
Try on the right side on the right side of the roadMemory after memory runs through my mind
You standing in every picture
After all this time
Where will we go from here
Still together after all these years
Summers have come and gone
But all love goes on and on
You could ask for more than that
I’m looking forward
Not looking back
Can hardly wait for the days that are coming down
And when they will lead us into places
No one else has found
And I promise you
I’ll love you for a thousand years
Day after day
What else could I say?
But I love you
No regrets just respect for all that we’ve done right
From where I stand
Our future still looking bright
Where will we go from here?
Still together after all these years
(x2)
Not looking backOn an old cot bay from around the lake
My baby said to me
This ain’t no time
For any nickel and dime
Or a wasted memory
So you all gather round and about the town
And it sounds like history
And our rhythm is great
It’s on the way
That brought you back to me
He cool you
Can't fool you, Bamboula
Down in Congo square
Not so long ago
A creole beat would play
And an old court room in a big bad moon
Would dine on end
The days go rumble in a mumble jumbo way
Sweet heart dear whit her hear real
You play each day
I’m calling
You owe it
You all in
Bamboula
With a creole girl
And a cranberry lane
Taking all my breath away
With every little age delayed
Feeling also
There’s no time to hesitate
Let us keep it straight
Never separate
This is not to intervene
Engagin’ the raging
It’s cagin’
Engagin’ the raging
It’s cagin’
I’m calling
You all in
I’m calling
You all in
I’m calling
You all inIs not what you got
It’s what you give
It’s not how you die
It’s how you live
It’s not what you read
It’s what you solve
It’s not what you keep now
It’s what you let go
Well, Now now easy does it
Make this moment last
Don’t worry about the future
Don’t forget about the past
It don’t really matter
Where I’ve been
Or what I’ve done
I just keep on searching
For that island in the sun
I’m just searching
For that island in the sun
I’m gonna find my island in the sun
No No location
It ain’t on the map
It takes concentration
All into your lap
It ain’t in the whiskey
It ain’t in the drug
It could be a woman with you
Who leads you to love
Easy does it
Make this moment last
Don’t worry about the future
Don’t forget about the past
Don’t really matter
Where I’ve been
Or what I’ve done
I just keep on searching
For that island in the sun
I’m just searching
For that island in the sun
I’m gonna keep on searching
Island in the sun
Once upon a time
I couldn’t move without a spliff
Then I wouldn’t stop hiding
I got so much more to give
I got so much more to give
I got so much love to give
It don’t really matter
Where I’ve been
Or what I’ve done
I just keep on searching
For my island in the sun
I’m just searching
I’m gonna keep on searching
For that island in the sun
Island in the sun
I got to keep on searching
Island in the sunWe met on a Friday night
I saw some other guy holding you tight
I thought that I didn't stand a chance
I caught your eye at the end of the dance
I knew from the moment we said hello
It had to be more than touch and go
It had to be more than touch and go
Let me tell you one more time
I'm so glad that you are mine
This could have been just one more night
Now I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life
It makes me happy to know you know
This is more than touch and go
This is more than touch and go
I like it when you're around me
I was blessed the moment you found me
From daybreak to dark night
You make everything all right
Because of you I've come to know
This is more than touch and go
It's so easy to fall in love
But hard to hold on tight enough
I live the life I was dreaming of
Now that I found you
What we found as the years go by
Is nothing changes if we don't try
To see each others point of view
And build a love that's deep and true
Sometimes fast and sometimes slow
Everything is touch and go
Life is more than touch and go
Ever since we said hello
Life is more than touch and go
Life is more than touch and go
Life is more than touch and goSometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm lost
But sometimes I'm found
I look at you, and I can see
Why I'm still look around
It's clear to me
If I knew then what I know now
I'd do it all again with you anyhow
We've been together from the very start
It wasn't easy but we had the heart
We didn't know what we had to go through
I'm just so happy that I did it with you
If I knew then what I know now
I'd do it all again with you anyhow!
Confirmation, when I look at you
Confirmation, that this think it's true
Confirmation, that we got it right
Confirmation, that you're here tonight!
Some people try and make up their mind
But you and I we've known all this time
At the end of the day when the sun goes down
I'm glad to say that we're still around
If I knew then what I know now
I'd do it all again with you anyhow!
Confirmation!
Confirmation!When you're feeling stuck in the day to day
Having trouble finding your way
Let love lead, let love lead
When you're all caught up in fear and doubt
And you just can't see your way out
Let love lead, let love lead
By now I know you know
It's going to take you where you need to go
You got to let love lead, let love lead
When talking heads talk, but nothing rings true
And every day you're more confused
Let love lead, let love lead
When the troubled world makes no sense
All I know the best defense is to
Let love lead, let love lead
If we're ever going to get somewhere
Only one thing can take us there
Let love lead
You got to let love lead
When it just comes down to me and you
And we feel we don't know what to do
We've got to let love lead, let love lead
By now we all know
It's going to take us where we need to go
We've got to let love lead (let love lead)
Let (let love) Love Lead (Let Love lead)
Let (Gotta let) Love Lead (Let love lead)
(let love, let love lead)
Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories
I got my bag and got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
Long to hear that "all aboard!"
Seven
That's the time we leave
At seven
I'll be waiting out for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track
That takes me back
Never thought my heart could be so yearning
Why did I decide to roam?
Got to take this sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home
I said seven
That's the time we leave
At seven
I'll be waiting out for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track
That takes me back
I never thought my heart could be so yearning
Why did I decide to roam?
Got to take this sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home
Maybe I'd better go by plane!Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are, I think of you
Night and day
Day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room, I think of you
Night and day
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
Day and night, night and dayWhy do you whisper, green grass?
Why tell the trees what ain't so?
Whispering grass, the trees don't have to know
No, no
Why tell them all your secrets?
Who kissed there long ago?
Whispering grass, the trees don't need to know
Don't you tell it to the breeze
'Cause they will tell the birds and bees
And everyone will know
Because you told the blabbering trees
Yes, you told them once before
It's no secret anymore
 (x2)
Why tell them all the old things?
They're buried under the snow
Whispering grass don't tell the trees
'Cause the trees don't need to knowPack up all my cares and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye, bye, blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar is sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird
No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye
Pack up all my cares and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye, bye, blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar is sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird
I said, no one here could love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
So, make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird,I said blackbird
I said blackbird,Oh, blackbird, bye, byeI'm a fool to care
When you treat me this way
I know I love you
But what can I do?
I'm a fool to care
I'm a fool to cry
When you tell me goodbye
You left me so blue
When you were untrue
I'm a fool to care
I know I should laugh
And call it a day
But I know I would cry
If you went away
I'm a fool to care
When you don't care for me
So why should I pretend
I lose in the end
I'm a fool to care
Brrr!
I'm a fool to care
When you treat me this way
I know I love you
But what can I do?
I'm a fool to careSometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song
Beside a garden wall where stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrainWhat will I do at sundown
What will I do at dawn
What will I do at noontime
Now that I've found you gone?
What will I do for sunshine
With nothing but the rain?
How can I smile
Find life worthwhile
With a heart that's filled with pain?
My, how I miss
Your tender kiss
And the wonderful things you would do
I run my hands
Through silvery strands
'Cause I'm blue, turning grey over you
Well, you used to be
So good to me
That's when I was a novelty
Now you have new thrills in view
Found someone new
Left me blue, turning grey over you
I said, how can I smile
Find life worthwhile
With a heart that's filled with pain?
You used to be
So good to me
That's when I was a novelty
Well now you have found some new thrills to view and some new buddy friends and I don't know what to do
Because I'm blue turning grey over you
Yeh, come on, hit me, daddy, hit me
Let me hear it one time!
Oh yeah
Ba-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-so-so-so-so
Ba-sa-sa-sa-sa-dootsie-dootise-doo
I just lost myself there, child, ha! Ha! Ha!Love is a many splendoured thing
It's the April rose that only grows
In the early spring
Love is nature's way of giving
A reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist, two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart
And taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendoured thingDream, when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share
Of memories there
So dream, when the night is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dreamUh - doo-doo-doo
You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it until the petals fall
You always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all
You always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all
It's because I love you most of all
Uh - doo-doo-dooHave I told you lately that I love you?
Could I tell you once again somehow?
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?
Darling, I'm telling you now
This heart would break in two if you refuse me
I'm no good without you anyhow
Dear, have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
Have I told you lately that I miss you
When the stars are shining in the sky?
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me?
Darling, I'm telling you now
With someone like you
A pal so good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to God alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace
Where joys never cease
Out there beneath the kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest
Somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go byWhen I was a little boy
Way back home in Liverpool
My mama told me, I was great
Then when I was a teenager
I knew that I had got something going
All my friends told me I was great
And now I'm a man
A woman took me by the hand
And you know what she told me, I was great
I was in the greatest show on earth
For what it was worth
Now I'm only thirty-two;
And all I want to do, is boogaloo!
(Hey!)
I looked in the mirror
I saw my wife and kids
And you know what they told me, I was great
Yes, my name is Billy Shears
You know it has been for so many years
Now I'm only thirty-two;
And all I want to do, is boogaloo!
Hey, hey, hey
I'm the greatest and you better believe it, baby!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
I'm going to be the greatest in this world, (ho!)
In the next world and in any world! (hey!)
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
AlrightHave you seen my baby on the avenue?
You know she's driving me crazy
With the funny things she do
I seen her with the milkman
Riding down the street
When you're through with my baby, milkman
Send her home to me
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
You know it's been so long
Since she has been gone
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I seen her with the gypsies, dancing in the woods
She's always been unfaithful to me
She's never been good
I said, "please, don't talk to strangers, baby."
But she always do
She said, I will talk to strangers if I want to
Because I'm a stranger too."
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more
I thought I'd make it
The day you went away
But I can't make it
'Til you come home again to stay-yi-yay-yi-yay
I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey
Now you're expecting me
To live without you
But that's not something
That I'm looking forward to
I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any moreUh-hoo!
It's a sunshine life for me
If I could get away from this cloud over me
Seems to just follow me around
It's a sunshine life for me
If I could get away from this cloud over me
Seems to just follow me around
There's a good life had for free
When you're out in the country
That's what I could use
If I could get away there soon
It's a sunshine life for me
If I could get away from this cloud over me
Seems to just follow me around
There's a good life had at sea
If you're not in the navy
That's the life for you
Sail away, Raymond, sail away
Ho!Ah!
Now most folks just bore me
Always imposing
And I'd rather meet a tree
Somewhere out in the cornfield
And it's a sunshine
And it's a sunshine
I said, sunshine
It's a sunshine
Ha! Ha! Ha! Hoo!Whew!
You come on like a dream, peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful
And you're mine. (mine, all mine)
You're all ribbons and curls
Ooh, what a girl
Eyes that sparkle and shine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine
(mine, all mine, mine, mine)
You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed, i could not stop
You walked out of my dreams, into my arms
Now you're my angel divine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine
You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed, i could not stop
You walked out of my dreams, into my arms
Now you're my angel divine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?One, two, three, four!
I phoned up my doctor to see what's the matter
He said, "come on over."
I said, "do I have to?"
My knees started shaking, my wrist started aching
When my doctor said to me:
Ooh my my, oh my my, can you boogie, can you slide?
Oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie if you try
Oh my my, oh my my, it's guaranteed to keep you alive
The head nurse she blew in, just like a tornado
When they started dancing, i jumped off the table
I felt myself healing and as i was leaving
This is what they said to me:
Now if you should slow down and you're feeling low down
Don't call up your doctor, just grab you a partner
It's what you've been missing, I've got your prescription
That boogie woogie remedy
"oh my my, oh my my, watch me boogie, watch me slide
Oh my my, (ow!) Oh my my, born to boogie, born to slide. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, oo-wee, boogie, oo-wee, aye. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, play that boogie, play that slide. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, love that boogie, love that slide. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, oh, my boogie, oh, my slide. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on, baby, come on now. (can you boogie)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on, baby, I'm willing to die. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on, baby, come on, try. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my."Step lightly
You're moving too fast
Take your time, boy
Soon the pain will pass
In the meantime
You gotta find yourself a love
That's going to last
Step lightly
Things will work out fine
Nice and easy
All it takes is time
Please, believe me
I wish this song was yours instead of mine
Now don't be angry at what I'm telling you
I'd be happy if you would see it too
But in the meantime
Find yourself a love that's true to you
But in the meantime, (meantime)
Find yourself a love that's going to last
Now I told you
Things don't work out fast
Gotta go now
Let's forget the past
But in the meantime, (in the meantime)
You gotta find yourself a love that's going to last
You gotta find a love that lastSix o'clock in the morning, you've just gone to sleep
I wipe a tear from my eye
It can't be the kind of company I keep
That keeps me asking, you keep me asking
You keep me wondering why
I don't treat you like I'd like to treat you
Every planet in the sky is in your eyes
But I don't treat you like i
No, I don't treat you like i
No, I don't treat you like i should
It could be the comfort going to my head
That makes me want to dream of you
But while you're sleeping softly in your bed
I want to tell you, I'd like to tell you
I'd love to tell you too
I (I) don't (don't) treat (treat) you (you)
Like I'd like to treat you
Every diamond in the sky is in your eyes
But I don't treat you like I
No, I don't treat you like I
No, I don't treat you like I should
I know you would say, you love my way
It's good enough for you
But i know for sure, I could do more, (more) more. (more)
I want to tell you, I'd like to tell you
I'd love to tell you too
I (I) don't (don't) treat (treat) you (you)
Like I'd like to treat you
Every diamond in the sky is in your eyes
Every time I see you walking down the street
I say, you're the kind of woman I just gotta meet
You look so good and you look so fine
And one of these days I'm going to make you mine
Your eyes are green and your legs are long
And if I'm going to get you, well, I got to be strong
But you're like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed
Devil woman, you're like a stranger to me
Devil woman, this ain't the way it should be
Every time I see you in the neighbourhood
I say, you're the kind of woman that makes me feel good
I want to beat you up then I want to be kind
And one of these days I'm going to make you mine
Sexy Sadie, you look like the devil to me
Devil woman, that's not the way it should be
Early in the morning when the sun is hot
All i do is think about the things you got
But you're like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed
Every time I see you walking down the street
I say, you're the kind of woman i just gotta meet
But you're like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed
But you're like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed
You look like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed
I said, you look like the devilFor you and me, babe, it's time that we part
And between you, babe, i gave you my heart
For these few moments
I wish we could start at the top again
For me and you, babe, it's the end of our date
Me and the band, babe, all thought it was great
To entertain you
But it's getting late and it's time to leave
Now I want to tell you the pleasure really was mine
Yes, I had a good time, singing and drinking some wine
And when the sun sets in the sky
And you close your weary eyes
I'll be in some night-club, getting high, that's no lie
Now you and me, babe, we may meet again
And in the meanwhile, stay out of the rain
But keep your nose dry
And give as a smile if you liked the show
Now I want to tell you the pleasure really was mine
Yes, I had a good time, singing and drinking some wine
Though I may not be in your town
You know that I can still be found
Right here on this record, spinning 'round, with the sounds
For you and me, Dave, they turned out the lights
The violins stayed to wish you good night
Me and the band-aid are reaching the end, so it's off we go
Goodbye, everybody!
Come on, lads, play it for me, boys, there we are
Well, it's the end of the night and I'd just like to say thank you to everyone involved
In this piece of plastic we're making
Good, old Jim Keltner, Klaus Voorman, Nicky Hopkins, George Harrison and John
Lennon, Paul Mccartney
Richard Perry, who's producing this masterpiece, Bill Schnee, ever smiling, ever
Loving, Vini Poncideo and all his other friends and everybody else who joined in and
Helped us on this wonderful record
So it's a big good night from your friends and mine, Ringo StarrIt don't come easy
You know it don't come easy
It don't come easy
You know it don't come easy
Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues
And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy
Forget about the past and all your sorrows
The future won't last
It will soon be over tomorrow
I don't ask for much, I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it just ain't easy
Open up your heart, let's come together
Use a little love
And we will make it work out better
Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues
And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy
Peace, remember peace is how we make it
Here within your reach
If you're big enough to take it
I don't ask for much, I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it don't come easyLives on a farm, got plenty of charm, beep, beep
He's got no cows but he's sure got a whole lot of sheep
And brand new wife and a family
And when he comes to town
I wonder if he'll play with me
Laying in bed, watching TV, cookie!
With his mama by his side, she's Japanese
They scream and they cried, now they're free
And when he comes to town
I know he's going to play with me
He's a long-haired, cross-legged guitar picker, um-um
With his long-legged lady in the garden picking daisies for his soup
A forty acre house he doesn't see
Because he's always in town
Playing for you with me
I play guitar, A - D - E
I don't play bass 'cause that's too hard for me
I play the piano if it's in C
And when I go to town I want to see all three Looked at the sky, what did I see?
I saw someone looking at me
And I'm down and out, down and out
Well, I'm down, so down, down and out
Alright, Gary!
I left Louisiana, I had me big plans
To go out and take me all over this land
To see me the world, I left my sweet girl
And gave it a whirl but now here I stand
Along side the road with holes in my soul and my shoes
And beaucoups of blues
Oh, sweet magnolia
Breath carried over the marsh by a breeze from the gulf
I'm coming home, (coming home)
I've had me enough
Oh, where are the things I saw in my dreams?
Where's the happy that freedom should bring?
I see me today and know yesterday
That I threw away my most precious things
I see me a man who's lonely, wants only to lose
Beaucoups of blues
Oh, sweet magnolia
Breath carried over the marsh by a breeze from the gulf
I'm coming home, (coming home)
I've had me enough
I'm coming home, (coming home)
I've had me enoughHer mother wrote a letter
Said she thought it would be better
If she would just stay gone
She knew of her condition
But she wouldn't give permission
For her to come back home
So she called the boy who loved her
But all he did was snub her
Said, "Face it on your own"
Mm-mm, love don't last long
A young man got unlucky
And got busted in Kentucky
Asked his dad to go his bail
But his dad had big ambitions
With the local politicians
Told his son to go to hell
He hung himself that morning
And the note that they found on him
Said, "Dad, please take me home"
A woman told her husband
She lived every day to love him
Nothing else fits in her plans
Then without a warning
He came home from work one morning
Found her there with another man
In a fit of anger
He took her life and the stranger's
Then he took his own
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mmI brought her here from Arkansas
A simple country girl
To try a Californian way of life
But it didn't take her long to learn
The ways of the modern world
Now she's California's fastest moving wife
She's working on it over time
And soon she'll finish me
And the world's saddest man will live here in Los Angeles
Of all the things she's ever done
She's making this her best
I got the fastest growing heartache in the west
'Til we came here no man had ever
Touched her heart but me
She'd never tasted any lips but mine
But I know now, man have seen
What only I should see
Since her lips has tasted California wine
She's working on it over time
And soon she'll finish me
And the world's saddest man will live here in Los Angeles
Of all the things she's ever done
She's making this her best
I got the fastest growing heartache in the westSoftly I search my memory
And hope I may find yesterday
And just like her, my thoughts wander
And like her quietly slip away
Love brings out the weakness in a man
And I'm so weak I just can't stand
To be without her
Without her
Without her
There was a time she walked with me
But yesterday comes only one time
And I can see a tomorrow
With yesterday clinging to my mind
Time will take her memory they say
But it gets harder every day
To live without her
Without her
Without herEvery night she's on the corner
She's got her business in the street
Her smile may make you think that you can own her
But that smile's reserved for everyone she sees
Woman of the night, I've heard them call her
But she's still a woman when morning comes around
She walks through the market as a lady
And she's kinda nice to have around
She's a woman of the night and I love her
Although her love, my silver doesn't buy
It's worth the rain to have a little sunshine
And you laugh much louder when you learn to cry
I've seen them pay for her affection
But when morning comes, no one calls her name
She wakes to find no sign of appreciation
Still she isn't wearing any shame
She's a woman of the night and I love her
Although her love, my silver doesn't buy
It's worth the rain to have a little sunshine
And you laugh much louder when you've learned to cryIf Italked about the good times
There wouldn't be much to say
For seldom happy memories come to mind
If I talked about the sleepless nights
You brought my way
I'd be talking all the time
For every dream that came my way
A million passed me by
I thought I couldn't be hurt more
Then you said goodbye
If talking now of other things
Would get you off my mind
I'd be talking all the time
For every dream that came my way
A million passed me by
I thought I couldn't be hurt more
Then you said goodbye
If talking now of other things
Would get you off my mind
I'd be talking all the time
Yeah Ringo'd be talking all the timeOoh...one, two
Mama, I guess you have stood and cursed
The day I found that old guitar
When uncle Harry died
The one we found in the boot of his old car
I remember how my little fingers blistered
When I tried to learn to play
I bet you never dreamed that old guitar
Would put me where I am today
Yes, it's been a lot of years
I guess it's been an interesting life
No, mam, I never found another woman
That I wanted for a wife
I guess the first time showed us
That I wasn't the domesticated kind
But I don't blame her for getting tired
Of living from a suitcase all the time
Yes, I know sometimes it looks
Like I've just simply thrown my life away
I'd just always figured that if I hung on
I'd make it big some day
I guess it takes a special breed
To live this way and think the way I think
But you'll be glad to hear that anymore
I ain't near as bad to drink
How is Tommy doing with the business
Now that daddy's passed away?
I'm sure daddy always knew that Tom
Would be the one to take his place
And when he tried to lecture me
I'd sit and pick and sing and let him nag
But way down deep inside I think
He always knew that hardware ain't my bag
We open Monday night in Bolton city
For another two week stand
I wish there was some way that you and Tom
Could come and hear my band
Wish I had the time to tell you 'bout the
Places that I've been, the things I saw
And I'll send the fifteen dollars soon
As I get to the club and make a draw
When you're hot, you're hot there
Ah, I mean, ah, when...what is
When you're hot, you're hot, yeah, okay
Mm-mm
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!
All right
Ho
I've got my dog and he's real meanLook at me now, ain't I a sight?
Eyes bloody red, face puffy white
Hair tangled up and wrinkled old clothes
I'm a living example of a big overdose of
Wine, women and loud happy songs
I had all three but none lasted long
The women ran off, I drank all the wine
And the songs died away when I ran out of dimes
It's strange how the wine works on a fool
It seeps through his mind, leaves him glued to the stool
Women leave you wishing you'd just never been
But the songs make you happy, soon you're searching again for
Wine, women and loud happy songs
I had all three but none lasted long
The women ran off, I drank all the wine
And the songs died away when I ran out of dimesYou're so different from anyone I've ever known
And to try to change you now, would be all wrong
Sometimes I don't understand everything you say
But I wouldn't have you any other way
I wouldn't want you if you weren't you
And I'll admit, I don't understand half the things you do
Sometimes I don't go along with things you do each day
But I wouldn't have you any other way
I wouldn't want you if you weren't you
And I'll admit, I don't understand half the things you do
Sometimes I don't go along with things you do each day
But I wouldn't have you any other way
Sometimes I don't go along with things you do each day
But I wouldn't have you any other wayThere's a honky tonk in this town
They call the loser's lounge
And I guess I'm a charter member, you could say
Since love has turned me down
Nothing to do but hang around
And listen to all the fools who come to say
That life is full of heartaches for a poor boy
'Cause a bank roll can turn his woman's head around
Ain't no use to try and run away or move to another town
'Cause anywhere a poor boy goes there's a loser's lounge
Had a real good friend named Sam
Said he just couldn't understand
Why in the world his sweet love let him down
But a rich man caught her eye
He had the money for things to buy
Now there's a brand new member down at the loser's lounge
That life is full of heartaches for a poor boy
'Cause a bank roll can turn his woman's head around
Ain't no use to try and run away or move to another town
'Cause anywhere a poor boy goes there's a loser's lounge
Oh yeahTime it goes
But it moves so slow when you're waiting
And it's not much fun
When you let someone keep you waiting
But you had me and you've still got me
Wondering what you'll do
'Til you find your way back to me
I'll be waiting for you
Every day
Is yesterday when you're waiting
And you dream a lot
That's all you got when you're waiting
But you've had me and you've still got me
Wondering what you'll do
'Til you find your way back to me
I'll be waiting for you
Waiting
Waiting
But you've had me and you've still got me
Wondering what you'll do
'Til you find your way back to me
I'll be waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for youPatiently she stares down the runway
Today's the day that he is coming home
Seems like he's been gone a lifetime
And a lifetime is a long time to be gone
But there are songs that need singing
And there are things that must be done
There are thoughts that still need thinking
And there are wars that must be won
He was just a boy when they sent for him
And overnight turned him into a man
Proudly he had served his country
In a war he didn't seem to understand
The flag still waves, his war is over
He'll never have to kill again
And as she waits, she thinks it over
Is winning worth the prize we pay to win?
Her thoughts keep wandering to his childhood
When all his hand grenades were merely toys
And "war" was just a game that he was playing
With plastic guns like other little boys
And every day when play was over
He'd put his little toys away
And she'd be standing, waiting for him
The way she's waiting here today
As the plane stops she starts thinking
Will he still look the way he did before?
Or will his eyes reflect the pain of killing
Like most young men when they come home from war?
These last few minutes seem like hours
She tries her best not to cry
But there's that hearse filled up with flowers
Did he really have to die?
No, no, no, noWaiting for you to come and see me
Waiting for you to come and see me
Where are you
My coochy, coochy, coochy, coochy, coo?
Come on to me and let me see you
Come on to me and let me see you
Where are you
My coochy, coochy, coochy, coochy, coo?
I've traveled all over
Seen everything there is to see
Where are you
My coochy, coochy, coochy, coochy, coo?
I've got everything that I ever wanted
Done everything I ever wanted to do
Where are you
My coochy, coochy, coochy, coochy, coo?
Oh, let me hear it
(ah! Ah!)
(done everything that there is to do
Well, I've done everything that there is to do
Well, where are you, my coochy, coo?
Where are you, my coochy, coo?
I said, where are you, my coochy, coo?I know a man who just works out on Twitter
Just getting fat, yeah, he's not gettin’ thinner
Looks out the window, and what does he see
He don't see nothing, he got no one to please
Gotta get up, you gotta get up
You gotta get up to get down (Get down)
Everybody's on the Internet, what’s up with that
Your body just waitin' for your brain to come back
Can't be cool just sittin' around
You gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
I said you gotta get up to get down
Get down
You gotta get up to get down
I said you gotta get up to get down
You gotta get up to get down
I got a woman, you know what I mean
I got the crackers, but she's got the cream
Every morning when I open my eyes
My heart stops beating when I see her big smile
Everybody's on Facebook, doin' their thing
Nobody knows what the thing is
Tweetin' up a storm, yeah, they’re crawlin’ on the ground
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up, gotta get up
Gotta get up to get down
You gotta get up, you gotta get up

You gotta get up to get downIt's not love that you want
Yes, it's love that you need
Give me love
Some days when you fall apart
Waking up with a broken heart
We've been there before
Just don't know what to do
And when you're full of doubt
Always looking for the easy way out
Searching for love
But nothing's comin' through
It never works out
Runnin' away (Runnin' away!)
You know you gotta stand up
And face the day
It's not love that you want
But it's love that you need
Give me love
When you're feelin' the sun don't shine
Don't worry, we got plenty of time
All you can do
Is let that feelin' go
You're not alone at the end of the day
There's always someone who can show you the way
Just reach out
It's always up to you
It never works out
Runnin' away (Runnin' away!)
You know you gotta stand up
And face the day
It's not love that you want

The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one

Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the settin' sun
When the day is done
God bless our love
God bless our love
Spendin' our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end
World without end
Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God bless our love
God bless our loveWe were takin' a summer stroll
The ocean seemed so blue
You were holdin' my hand, feet in the sand
Like lovers do
This reminds me of so many years ago
Times like these, I just got to let you know
It's one of those things, it's magic
Like only lovers know
It's one of those things, it's magic
And I never wanna let you go
It's one of those things, it's magic
I hope it never ends
I don't wanna sound romantic
I wanna be more than just friends
I can still see the sun in your eyes
After all these years
You make all of the stars come out
The darkness disappears
I'm reminded of just how much you care
My life is never empty because you are always there
It's one of those things, it's magic
Like only lovers know
It's one of those things, it's magic
And I never wanna let you go
It's one of those things, it's magic
Like only lovers know
It's one of those things, it's magic
And I never wanna let you go
It's one of those things, it's magic
I hope it never ends
I don't wanna sound romantic
I wanna be more than just friends
It's one of those things, it's magic

Get real lucky and find somebody
That you can love

Thank the Lord for the lessons we've learned

Send loveFrom Paul to John
To playin' in German bars
From mono to stereo
Hittin' number one
And havin' all the fun
And lightin' up the radio
Nothin' stays the same
But I'm still in the game
What's my name? (Ringo!)
Spinning 'round and 'round
We broke the speed of sound
Tearin' up the freeway
With the tumblin' of the dice
And gettin' bad advice
We had to call a mayday
They said we've had the last
We're a thing of the past
But I can still rock 'n' roll
You can't deny
We're doin' somethin' right
It's not my first rodeo
Nothin' stays the same
But I'm still in the game
What's my name? (Ringo!)
I can't get enough
Of peace and love
This is what I've come to understand
I'll pull myself together
Through all kinds of weather
I'll give you everything I can
Well, I've seen it all
From the mountains of Nepal
To Reno, Nevada
I've taken all the falls
I was climbin' up the walls
And now it doesn't matter
Nothin' stays the same
But I'm still in the game
What's my name? (Ringo!)
Now I'm playing on the run
And there is only one
What's my name? (Ringo!)
I can feel the love
From the stars above
What's my name? (Ringo!)
Followin' the sun
Where the river runs
What's my name? (Ringo!)
Now I've raised my hands
All across the lands
What's my name? (Ringo!)
Nothin' stays the same
But I'm still in the game
Nothin' stays the same
But I'm still in the game
Nothin' stays the same
But I'm still in the game
Hey, what's my name? (Ringo!)
What's my name? (Ringo!)Doesn't make a difference
Don't care how far
We can go the distance in my car
Don't bother with directions
Doesn't matter where we are
Cruising down the highway in my car
Hey!
In my car
I don't need no back seat drivers
So i leave them all behind
And problems, they can't find me in my car
In my car
Hey!
In my car
(in my car) 
(my car)When I woke up this morning
Much to my surprise
The sun was going down
And I was still alive
I looked into the mirror
And according to my eyes
The martians have invaded
It's hopeless
I went to see my doctor
To ask him what to do
Depending on the diagnosis
I said, "doc, I'm seeing double
And how are both of you?
No cause for alarm, it's hopeless
You don't stand a chance, it's hopeless
Everybody dance!
Well, there's paradise and doomsday
It depends on which comes first
There's inner peace through meditation
There's optimists and pessimists
I don't know which is worse
But the yogi mow mow, but the yogi mow mow
It's hopeless
The solution has been dissolved
The crisis has been resolved
There's no need to change your plans
It's a hopeless situation
For tomorrow is another day
And everything will be okay
And by the way, it's hopeless
(hopeless)You came into my life
When I was looking for an alibi
You looked in my eyes
And I could tell you no lie
I was making life, feel all right
But it wasn't good
Looking at you, looking at me
I knew you understood
I've been down for so long
Looking for a good disguise
Feeling sorry for myself
I didn't realize
That I was digging holes
Acting roles
With no lines to say
I was losing sleep, counting sheep
That never went away
I was waiting for you to come into my life
Making up stories or looking for an alibi
Now we're together
It's going to be never
We'll be parted again
I've loved you since the day we met
And that was way back when
I was making life, feel all right
In the same old way. (same old way)
I'm digging holes
Acting roles
With no lines to say
I was waiting for you to come into my life
Making up stories, looking for an alibi
Looking for an alibi
Oh, looking for an alibi
Oh, making those alibis
Oh, looking for an alibiHormone in production
Such a waste of time
Let's get down to business
I know I'm a stranger
You should know that I'm
Won't you be my baby?
Good girls should be careful
And always home on time
(good girls should be careful)
Don't misunderstand me
You can make the rules
But i'll make the arrangements
All you got to do is be my baby
Be my baby
Help you with your problems
You help me with mine
Won't you be my baby?
I can teach you things
You'll never learn in school
You don't have to thank me
All you got to do is be my baby
Be my baby, that's all you got to do
You'll take care of me, babe
And I'll take care of you
Won't you be my baby?
(be my baby) 
(baby, baby, baby, be my baby)
Babe, babe, babe, baby, babe
Come on, baby, come on, baby, now
Oh, baby, baby, (baby, baby) baby, baby
Be my baby, oh, be my baby
I said, babe, babe, babe, baby, babe
"turn the tape off just for me!"Well, she was walking down the street
Looking fine as she could be, hey, hey
Well, she was walking down that street
Looking fine as she can be
Well, you know i love you, baby
Woah, yeah, what I'd say
(she's about a mover) 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what I'd say
(she's about a mover) 
Well, you know I love you, baby
Woah, yeah, what I'd say, hey, hey
She strolled on up to me
Said, "hey, big boy, what's your name?" Hey, hey
Well, she strolled on up to me
She said, "hey, big boy, what's your name?"
If you want love and conversation
Woah, yeah, what I'd say
(she's about a mover) 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what I'd say
(she's about a mover) 
If you want love and conversation
Woah, yeah, what I'd say, hey, hey
Well, you know I love you, baby
Woah, yeah, what I'd say, hey, hey
Come on, do it to me, baby!
Yeah!I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Starts knocking on your front door
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things that you said - ooh
Though I know in my heart
We've drifted apart
Still i can't believe our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more, (you don't love me no more)
Don't love me no more, (love me no more)
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things that you said - ooh
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more, (no, don't love me no more)
Don't love me no more, (oh, you don't love me no more)
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more. (yo!)Hollywood is waltzing
Doing that double talking
Anything they could do
To make it through another L.A. night
And can you imagine
All those girls are strolling
All the boys are holding
They're doing their best to
Make it through another L.A. night
In a picture show life
In their own little world
In their own little space
They can be who they want to
In their own little place
Hollywood is reeling
With the double meaning
Anything they could say to
Make it through another L.A. night
And can you imagine
All the girls are smiling
All the boys are trying
Anything they can take to
Burn away another L.A. night
In a picture show life
They win and they lose
And they pick and they choose
They've been dancing for so long
What else can they do?
Hollywood is rocking
Doing the double talking
Anything they can do
To make it through another L.A. night
And can you imagine
All those girls are strolling
All those boys are holding
They're doing their best to
Make it through another L.A. night
In a picture show life
In their own little world
In their own little space
They can be who they want to
In their own little place
They can be who they want to
In their own little place
They can be who they want toYou don't have to say, I see it on your face
When tears fall
They leave a trace
I told myself it won't be long
It's too bad
To lose what we had
I thought our love song would go on and on
People talk, yes, I think they know
I guess that it must show
We've gone as far as we can go
They walk by and they whisper low
The rumors had to flow
We've gone as far as we can go
I'm going down 
I'm coming up 
I'm moving on (moving on) 
(well, we're moving on) moving onI was a sailor first, I sailed the sea
Then I got a job in a factory
Played Butlin's Camp with my friend Rory
It was good for him, it was great for me
Liverpool I left you, said goodbye to Madryn Street
I always followed my heart and I never missed a beat
Destiny was calling, I just couldn't stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down
Went to Hamburg, the red lights were on
With George and Paul, and my friend John
We rocked all night, we all looked tough
We didn't have much, but we had enough
Liverpool I left you, said goodbye to Madryn Street
I always followed my heart and I never missed a beat
Destiny was calling, I just couldn't stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down
In the U.S.A. when we played Shea
We were number one and it was fun
When I look back, it sure was cool
For those four boys from Liverpool
Liverpool I left you, said goodbye to Admiral Grove
I always followed my heart, so I took it on the road
Destiny was calling, I just couldn’t stick around
Liverpool I left you, but I never let you down
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Liverpool
Liverpool
Liverpool
Liverpool, come On
Liverpool
Liverpool, come on lads
Liverpool, let me hear it
(Liverpool) One more time
Liverpool
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
LiverpoolWhen I'm walking down the streets
And I feel it start to rain
I don't run for cover
I look up again and it's blue
I just have to think about you
When the road is getting rocky
All the seas getting rough
No matter what the trouble
It isn't very tough to get through
I just have to think about you
Like the rain or sunshine
Breaking through the stormy weather
Every time my heart beats
I remember that you're mine
Then I'm fine
When the world feels fast
And my life feels slow
When I'm feeling way down
Suddenly I know what to do
I just have to think about you (I'm thinking)
Like the rain or sunshine
Breaking through the stormy weather (breaking through)
Every time my heart beats
I remember that you're mine
Then I'm fine, so fine
I believe in magic and I do believe in love
So if I want to cast a spell
There's a little trick that I do
I just have to think about you
Yeah, it's true (true)
I just have to think about you
(Think about you) So I do
I've always got to think about you
I think about you
Always going to think about, think about
Always going to think about
Always going to think about, think about
Always going to think about, think about
Always going to think about, think about youFeel like I'm going under
My heart, it beats like thunder
For love, for love, for love
Why can't it be a saying?
This is a price we're paying
For love, for love, for love
You have to have a heart to have it broken
To hear the words of love softly spoken
It seems so easy
If love is coming in you better know it
Come and let it out, you got to show it
I'll stand in line, one more time for love
Well, there may be many times
We know the sun will always shine
I am yours and you are mine
We do it all for love
Everybody's got to know (that love)
That love is not like in the picture show (real love)
When you know, you really know
So do it all for love
There are good and bad days
You'll still love me always
For love, for love, for love
In this world we live in
We can always be forgiven
With love, with love, with love
As long as quiet is an emotion
Sometimes the tears are filling up the ocean
So embrace them
No matter how you try, you can't forget it
We can only make it better if you let it
We'll stand in line, together, one more time for love
Well there may be many times (for love)
We know the sun will always shine (in love)
I am yours and you are mine
We do it all for love
Everybody's got to know (that love)
That love is not like in the picture show (real love)
When you know, you really know
So do it all for love
I'll stand in line, forever, every time for love
(For love)
(In love)
I am yours and you are mine
Do it all for love
Everybody's got to know (that love)
That love is not like in the picture show (real love)
When you know, you really know
So do it all for love
For love
For loveWhat am I gonna be
What am I gonna say
What am I gonna do
Now that she's gone away
Now that she's gone away
Where am I gonna go?
What am I gonna say?
Where am I gonna turn
Now that she's gone away
Now that she's gone away
And here comes midnight
What didn't I do right
Didn't I love with everything I am?
I can still hear her
But I'm nowhere near her
One thing I'll never understand
How am I gonna sleep
How do I face the day
How do I carry on?
Now that she's gone away
Now that she's gone away
Why did it take so long?
Why it's hard to say
Why did I
Now that she's gone away
Now that she's gone away
It's five past midnight
But I still don't feel right
Right now, I'm ready to move on
It's time to move on, now that she's gone
I know what I'm gonna be
I know what I'm gonna say
I know what I'm gonna do
Now that she's gone away
Now that she's gone away
Now that she's gone away
(She's gone) Now that she's gone away
(She's gone) Now that she's gone away
(She's gone, she's gone away)
(She's gone)Gone are the days
Gone are the days
Sometimes you lose yourself
Nobody's there when you fight for help
Gone are the days
Gone are the days
I hope you find what you're looking for
You could choose love, it's an open door
I know you will believe me
When I say it don't come easy
Oh no, oh no it don't come easy (don't come easy)
You think you've got a problem
I know you've got a problem, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Oh yeah
I know you will believe me
When I say it don't come easy
Oh no, oh no it don't come easy (don't come easy)
You think you've got a problem
I know you've got a problem, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Oh yeah (oh yeah) la la la laEverybody has a dream that they hold on to
But what can they do to make it come true?
Everybody has a whole lot of life to live
But you've got to sit back
Oh, you gotta relax
You've got to love every breath you breathe
Look at the sky and believe (oh yeah)
Smile a little more as life goes by
With love in your eyes
Just give it a try
Give it a try
If you're tired of looking over your shoulder
It's time to take a look at yourself
Don't be left on the shelf
In the end you will surrender and then you'll be fine
Like everyone else
You'll be back in yourself
You've got to love every breath you breathe
Look at the sky and believe (oh yeah)
Smile a little more as life goes by
With love in your eyes
Just give it a try
Give it a try
Everybody makes mistakes sometimes
It's all right, it's all right
But you can have a better life my friend, here in the back
One day at a time and your life will shine
You've got to love every breath you breathe
Look at the sky and believe (oh yeah)
Smile a little more as life goes by
With love in your eyes
Just give it a try
Give it a try
Why kiss it goodbye?
Just give it a tryA little bit of love, a little bit of love
Is not enough but it's not too tuff
To give a little bit of love, a little bit of happiness
To give a little smile if only for awhile
Sitting by the river watching my life go by
I can be bigger but it's up to me to try
Now its time to make up my mind
A little bit of peace, a little bit of peace
Is not enough but it's not too tuff
To give a little bit of hope, settle for nothing less
In your heart, that's where you gotta start
It's really just a moment, everything you're going through
If you ever need me, I'll be there for you
Now its time to make up your mind
(Tuff love)
The love in your heart wasn't put there to stay
Now love is enough till you give it away
So why don't we start giving today
(Oh ah)
A little more light, that's what love will bring
A little more joy, a little less suffering
A little more hope will get you through
A little more truth inside of you
A little bit of love, a little bit of peace
Is not enough but it's not too tuff
To give a little love, a little bit of happiness
A little bit of hope, settle for nothing less
And now its time to make up your mind
Now its time to make up your mind
Now its time to make up your mind
Now its time to make up your mindLike the songs of long ago
Never fast and not too slow
And now that you're telling me
Some things should last forever
In other days and different times
When June and moon would always rhyme
A boy and a girl romancing
Dancing together
Music played this way
All I need is my imagination
Take me far away
Where I can be with everyone who loves me
Harry was a friend most true
He sang songs like this for me and you
Whenever I'm here without you
Pressed in together
Music played this way
All I need is my imagination
Take me far away
Where I can be with everyone who loves me
Can we get back the past? (the way of knowing)
How do we make it last? (just keep on growing)
Tomorrow is a yesterday
'Cause nothing ever goes away
The love that is living inside you
Will guide you forever
Music played this way
All I need is my imagination
Take me far away
Where I can be with everyone who loves me
Let me be with everyone who loves meWhen I was walking down the street in Spain
I met a girl who would not say her name
But all was not lost to circumstance
Later on she taught me how to dance
Her pasodobles
Now look where I am today
Strangers in perfect motion
Down by the Spanish ocean
El pasodobles
Lights were shining low - the music loud
We danced so close and slow, we drew a crowd
We were two together like candle's burnt
We became one and that's how I learnt
Her pasodobles
Now look where I am today
Strangers in perfect motion
Down by the Spanish ocean
El pasodobles
In the drift she said we did
But of course you know we didn't
She had treasures that I tried to fight
But she always kept them hidden
At the Bay of Biscay, I had no regrets
And as I sailed away, I could not forget
Her pasodobles
Now look where we are today
Strangers in perfect motion
Down by the Spanish ocean
El pasodoblesWell, if it's love that you want, I've got love that I can give
I'll give you love love love
You'll get all that I've got for as long as you live
I'll give you love love love
There's no doubt about it
You'll never be without it
Don't you know it's always there for you
So when you're feeling okay or when you're falling apart
I'll give you love love love
All I'm trying to say is if you open your heart
I'll give you love love love
There's no doubt about it
You're gonna scream and shout it
Let me tell you one more time, it's true
Well if it's love that you want, I've got love that I can give
I'll give you love love love
C'mon Steve
Every single little bit
Every single little bit, I love you
Every single little bit
Every single little bit, I love you
Every single little bit
Every single little bit, I love you
Every single little bit, I love you
Well if it's love that you want, I've got love that I can give
I'll give you love love love
You'll get all that I've got for as long as you live
I'll give you love love love
I'll give you love love love
I'll give you love love love
I'll give you love
I'll give you love
Love, loveForever takes so long
You turn around, it's gone
Everybody's here
But never for too long
The door of willingness will one day open
For everyone
Time will always heal
What the broken-hearted feel
The poet's say it's so
But I'm not sure it's real
I only know the answer is inside me
And everyone
Love is here
Everywhere it's calling if you hear
Love is opening your heart, it will appear
Love is
Love is here
The quiet helps me stand
A spirit guides my hand
And that is how I know
That there's a bigger plan
This world is not for you and me alone
It's for everyone
Love is here
Everywhere it's calling if you hear
Love is opening your heart, it will appear
Love is
Love is here
A war will still go on
But love will come on strong
You have to look inside
To see where you've come from
I only wish for nothing less
Than everything
Love is
Love is here
Love is
LoveAre you ready to cross over
Are you ready to let go?
To face the final curtain
In the land of I don't know
Jesus was a wise man
And everyone's a saint
Are you ready to cross over
Are you ready?
You can read the good and bad book
And bring the bad book home
But is it fact or fiction
There's just one way to know
Buddha was dancing
Underneath the fig oak tree
He was ready to cross over
He was ready
So I hold on, hold on
It's good that you believe, but it's better if you know
So hold on, hold on
Someone's there to catch you when you're ready to let go
I was sitting by the Ganji
Looking for another way
But all roads lead to Heaven
No matter what they say
Krishna was a good man
Why was he so blue?
He was ready to cross over
He was ready
So I hold on, hold on
It's good that you believe, but it's better if you know
So hold on, hold on
Someone's there to catch you when you're ready to let go
Are you ready to cross over
Are you ready to let go?
To face the final curtain
In the land of I don't know
Everyone can get there
'Cause we all have a soul
Are you ready to cross over?
Are you ready?
So I hold on, hold on
It's good that you believe, but it's better if you know
So hold on, hold on
Someone's there to catch you when you're ready to let go
Someone's there to catch you when you're ready to let go
Someone's there to catch you when you're ready to let go
That's the real thing, isn't it?(One, two)
Got up this morning and packed my bags
Headed for the studio to finish this track
A lot going on and a lot to do
We gotta get it done 'cause we ain't coming back
We still got a lot of playing to do
Playing guitars are no troubles for you
We play really tight, we play really loud
We're gonna kick ass in front of the crowd
We're gonna play some rock and roll, that's true
Now we're heading down the highway to play it for you
We're on the road again
We're on the road again
We're traveling fast thru' the sky tonight
In 24 hours gonna make it right
A passenger's time seems to go to slow
We're telling stories and having a laugh
Singing my songs all around
Nothing's gonna matter when we roll up to play the show
As I open my eyes and wish you good day
I count the hours until we get to play
We're on the road again
We're on the road again
We're on the road again
We're gonna play some rock and roll, that's true
Now we're heading down the highway to play it for you
We're on the road again
We're on the road again
We're on the road again
We're on the road again
We're on the road, on the road
On the road againWoke up this morning I was feeling good
Turned up the radio I understood
Things are changing like never before
Then I go back to bed and close the door
It would be laughable if it wasn't sad
Yeah, laughable if it wasn’t sad
Picked up my cell phone and called a friend
They tried to tell me that it's not the end
I still remember how it used to be
How did this happen to you and me
It would be laughable if it wasn't sad
Yeah, laughable if it wasn’t sad
Let's all be honest, it's going to hell
But not forever
Don't be afraid, don't lose your place
We need to come together
They think they're different even I can see
It's  of loving for you and for me
It would be laughable if it wasn't sad
Yeah, laughable if it wasn’t sad
Yeah, laughable if it wasn’t sadAfter all this time we've had to share
The better life I’ve had 'cos your still there
I need to show you just how much I care
There were times, wasn't always easy
But we got through, nice to know
I’m back to face another day with you
There was joy sung for you
We've held hands for all these many years
We've hung around and wiped each other's tears
Once again, I'm glad to have you by my side
Our love, it never ends
I'm blessed to spend another day with you
As I look up to the sky
The sun begins to fade
I asked in all the questions, how and why
I turn to see your face
The years have all gone by
Your always there to show me the way
Everything must change
From bad to good we cast away these chains
If I had to do it all again
With you by my side
Darkness always turns into the light
As I look up to the sky
The sun begins to fade
I asked in all the questions, how and why
As I turn to see your face
The years have all flown by
Your always there to show me the way
As I look up to the sky
And the sun begins to fade
I asked in all the questions, how and why
I turn to see your face
The years have all flown by
Your always there to show me the wayI'm on the road, I'm on the run
Don't want to look back at what I've done
The many miles, it gets to go
Some days are high, some days are low
I know what I've got to do
And I've got to do it right now
And this one thing is true
I got to break it through
I'm breaking through
At the speed of sound
Some nights are high, some nights are low
Some months go fast and some go slow
I've been told time and time again
It's not about if, it's all about when
I know what I've got to do
And I've got to do it right now
And this one thing is true
I'm breaking through
Breakin' through
At the speed of sound
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
At the speed of sound
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
At the speed of sound
I've been told time and time again
It's not about if, it's all about when
I know what I've got to do
And I've got to do it right now
And this one thing is true
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
At the speed of sound
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
At the speed of sound
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
At the speed of sound
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
I'm breaking through
At the speed of soundWhen you wake up
You gotta make up
Your mind, what you gonna to do
You can't lie there
And sigh there
That life's too hard for you
Take your time, now
Change your mind, now
There's nothing that can't be done
Somebody's has to go live your life
And you're the only one
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just waiting at the bottom of the hill
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just standing still
Start moving
Start grooving
To the rhythm of the universe
Stop talking
Stop walking
You gotta move one foot first
Raise your head
Get out of bed
To see what's going on (to see what's going on)
Make a better world where you're going
Than the one you're coming from
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just waiting at the bottom of the hill
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just standing still
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just waiting at the bottom of the hill
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just standing still
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just waiting at the bottom of the hill
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just standing still
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just waiting at the bottom of the hill
You don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing
You're just standing still
You're just standing still
Listen to me, brothers and sistersShe is The King of the Kingdom
She tells me I'm in command
Some day she’s a towering inferno
Together you live and you leave
She's straight on the track
You don't have to look back
I can’t wait till it's time to return
She is The King of the Kingdom
She tells me I'm in command
She is The King of the Kingdom
But I'm in charge of the band
I am the man with the plan
So let's sing praises for Haile Selassie
One love is just plenty for me
One love
One heart
Bob Marley always did it for me
One love
One heart
Keep in time on a musical journey
 like though the sounds you may hear
But how long I'm away
I wake for the day
To go back to the love I hold dear
Back to the love I hold dear
She is The King of the Kingdom
She tells me I'm in command
She is The King of the Kingdom
But I'm in charge of the band
I am the man with the plan
So let’s sing praises for Haile Selassie
One love is just plenty for me
One love
One heart
Bob Marley always did it for me
One love
One heartNot so long ago back in Liverpool
Playing every show while working in the factory
Music was the scene, I was on my way
Chasing my own dream with Rory and the Hurricanes
Before he became the keeper of the plane
And by the name of Johnny Guitar
Electricity coming through his fingers
Every time he plays, everybody linger
Electricity, and I still remember back in the day
No one there will forget the way he played
Electricity
As it turned out good
Made it here to Hollywood
Playing just the same
I guess there's things that never change
Just like from the start
Every night I gave my heart
Trying to make it good
Just like I know I could
The gangster of love
Is smiling from above
So we play this one to Johnny Guitar
Electricity coming through his fingers
Every time he plays, everybody linger
Electricity, and I still remember back in the day
No one there will forget the way he played
Electricity
Electricity coming through his fingers
Every time he plays, everybody linger
Electricity, and I still remember back in the day
No one there will forget the way he played
ElectricityWhen we first met
On the rooftop of that hotel
Everyone around us could see, we got on well
So we took the elevator straight up to forty second floor
When we kissed in your doorway, it's like we never kissed before
I was in love again, and I knew that you were too
We spent every night together, nothing was kaboom
And early in the morning the sunlight in your hair
I knew we stick together, you were the answer to my prays
How could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)
How could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)
How could I (How could I) be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)
All the time we spent together so close and true
Living for each other together thru the blue (thru the blue)
Two stars like lovers beneath the Tennessee moon
We near as we could be
Johnny Cash and June
How could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)
How could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long
How could I (How could I) be so wrong? (so wrong) for so long (for so long)
For so long (for so long)
For so long
Then I heard a rumor, from an old friend of mine
He been seeing someone else, I never saw the signs
I hope he make she happy, and that he is happy too
And just like all the others, I'll get over you
But how could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (for so long)
How could I be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (so long)
How could I (How could I) be so wrong? (so wrong) For so long (so long)
How could I… be so wrong? For so LongWake up baby
Let your love light shine
Wake up baby

Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door;
I don’t hear it
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
I hear the clock a-ticking on the mantle shelf
I see the hands a-moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight and why I’m by myself;
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurts me so how I hate to see you go
Don’t pass me by, don’t make me cry
Yeah!
Don't make me blue
I’m sorry that I doubted you, you was so unfair
You were in a car crash and you lost your hair. (oh no!)
You said that you'd be late, about an hour or two
Well, that's all right, I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you
Don’t pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurts me so how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry
Don't make me blue (Don't make me blue)
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you. (I love you)
You'll never know it hurt me so how I hate to see you go

Ooh! Ooh! Ah!Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more
I thought I'd make it
The day you went away
But I can't make it
'Til you come home again to stay-yi-yay-yi-yay
I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey
Now you're expecting me
To live without you
But that's not something
That I'm looking forward to
I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any morePrivate property
Don't run off with it
You'll be breaking the law
Love monopoly
My philosophy
Don't go fooling with private property
'Cause she's mine, she belongs to me
And we'll get on fine as long as you agree
That she's mine private property
Private property
Have some common sense
You get off the fence
Don't go fooling with private property
It's known when we're in a crowd
That there's going to be no trespassing allowed
How can i disagree?
She insists that it's all for meChorus 1]
Wrack my brain, wrack my brain
Till my head's filled with pain
Wrack my brain
All dried up, i'm all dried up
All i have's this empty cup
All dried up
What i have, you don't want
What you want, i can't give
I got out of touch with you and yours
The way that you live
I try to do my best for you
While the sky pours down the rain
Wrack my brain
With a will there's a way
But there's no way i can see
Coming up with something you'd enjoy
As much as Tv
All the same, i play the game
Up and down old memory lane
Drumming is my madness
Drumming is my business
Drumming is my pleasure
Drumming makes me happy
Drumming makes me lose control
Drumming makes me rock and roll, yeah
Watch me now, rizz off
Do you think i'm sexy?
Do you think i'm silly?
Try a little tenderness, too
Drumming is my middle name
Drumming makes me go insane
I got rhythm
You got rhythm, too
Here we go again
Drumming is my madness
Drumming makes me crazy, ha! Ha! Ha
Ho
Drumming is my hobby
Drumming is a friend of mine
Is it any wonder?
You can call me thunder
My friends' name is lightning tooEverybody needs attention
Everybody wants to smile
Everybody needs a mention
Attention, attention, for a while
Come on, baby, give it all you've got
Get into the power of the plot
You know we'll only get it if we try
Give me your attention for a while
Feel it, feel it when you tell me
You've got time to give me
Time can run away
See it, see it in the children
People of tomorrow
Living for today
Your love is fine
Your love can be mine
Come on, baby, give it all you've got
Get into the power of the plot
You know we'll only get it if we try
Give it your attention for a while
Doo doo doo dooStop and take the time to smell the roses
Stop and take the time to fill your noses
Stop as you stroll through life, ("pitter patter, pitter patter
Stop and take the time to talk it over with your wife
I said, stop and take the time, take the time to read the label
Stop, you must remember clark and betty grable
Stop, there's no train to catch, no there isn't, rose
No, no, no
Come on, everybody, you've got to stop
Stop on the highway
Stop when you're in a car on that highway
Roll down your window
Look for a man in a porsche and say
"brother, let's get out and walk, let's go! Can you hear me?
Stop
You know when you're accident prone
Nobody likes you
Wave to a man in a rolls
'Cause he knows how to live, ha! Ha
Stop and take the time to stop that smoking
Stop, before the light turns green
You won't be blue
Stop, in the name of the law
"well, i was walking down the street the other day
You know, and i said to myself, what's all this hurry
What's all this hustle and bustle
Why don't i just stop, look at the pretty roses
Smell them for one moment, take the time to see
Take the time to smell, have a good time in life
Don't let everything pass you by, you're only here once
And I've been here longer than most of you
So stop and take the time to buy this album
So i can plant roses and smell them all day long
Stop everything you're doing
Run to your local record shop and say
"give me that record called 'stop
I'm going crazy with this record business
I want to stop it, you want me to stop it
Everybody wants it to stopPeople like you see it coming a mile off
Find it hard staying in line
It's not that no one really hears you
Just that nobody really cares
Like someone who's just seen the light
Like someone looking for a fight
Same thing every day, being foolish
Being asked to lose your seat
Don't look to me asking
To be helped up to your feet
Don't you know you're a dead giveaway?
You're a dead giveaway
Dead giveaway
Don't look to me 'cause i know your game
Nonsense merchant, hall of fame
Take it or leave it, you're a blind drunk
And if you ain't that, you're far too stoned
Somebody knocking at the door
You're a dead giveaway
I've seen you happy all the time
Don't live lonely life
Dead giveaway
See the pyramids across the nile
See the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
See the ocean from a silver plane
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Darling, you'll be lonesome too and blue
See the market place in old algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember till your dream appears
You belong to me
Oh, i'll be so alone without you, ("oh, i will, honey
Darling, darling, you'll be lonesome too
And you're going to be blue
(just to little all meI'm sure to fall
Fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet
And we are so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you
So hold me tight

I want you for the rest of my life
What did you say?
I want you for the rest of my lifeWasn't too long ago i was dying of an empty heart
When you get lonely, gets so easy to fall apart
Staying up all night
Looking for trouble soon as it would start
Then there was you there, loving me
Waiting for me to get smart
You got a nice way of believing in me
You got a nice way of telling me so, so i know
You got a nice way of believing in me
You got a nice way, let me know, so i know
Being' in love with you
Is like growing up into a child
All you got to do is look at me
Nothing i can do but smile
Back a few years ago i was blind
Now i can see for miles
Baby, you saved me, loving me
Will you stay for a while?
Tell me you love me, baby, tell me once again
Baby, it's good this loving you
Knowing that you're my friend

I wake up calling your name
But it's still not the same as have you right here with me
And if you go away, for only a day
You know that i'll still love you
There is nothing better than to love you
When you're near the way is clear, i love you
You gotta know
What is it for
Why is it so
And can you tell me?
I will be right there
Willing to share everything i can with you
And when you're by my side
I've no reason to hide i dream all my dreams about you
You and me are all we need, stay with me
Lovers need each other, please, stay with me
Ended a worker, according to plan
'Cause you're just a woman and i'm just a man
Whatever the future might happen to bring
It'll be the right thing
It's all been happening for a long, long time
There's a valley behind every mountain you climb
So turn up the music and open the door
Nothing left to wait for
Shine, shine your sweet light on me
You said you were a rider but you feel like a woman to me
Open the windows and unlock the locks
Ride all you can 'cause they may stop all your clocks
Let all your hair down and open the wine
Things will be really fine
By the open fireplace in my favorite dungarees
Played a few bars of a melody and it sounded sweet to me
Thought i get up and take a look around but my feet got in my way
Stumbled to the floor, she was right at the door, i could even see her face
But how could it be (how could it be
She ran away from me
My best friends gone and i'm so all alone
I kind-a miss you, brandy, i'm so all alone
When are you coming back home?
I really miss you, brandy, missing you every day
Are you coming home to stay?
Sitting on a lonely beach building houses out of sand
Like a little child with a fantasy, just a fraction of a man
I was in love when they put her down on my doorstep in the rain
I could feel the love coming into my heart through my window pane
But how could i know (how could i know
That she would up and go
My best friends gone and i'm so all alone. (alone
One, two, three, four

One, two, three, four
One, two...  (One, two, three, four)
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
If you drive a car, car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Don't ask me what I want it for
(Haha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Haha, Mr. Heath)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman!)
Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman!)Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins you'll see
I'll make love to you
If you want me toI want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
I've got time
I've got timeI've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with youIf I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ahYou don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
I need you
I need youThough you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like youChains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah

Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains

I'm in love with you, ooh
OohSince she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right, when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone

Don't-Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and bluesI don't like you, but I love you

But her eyes, they tantalize
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
I'll take my chances, for romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, no, this I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?
(She's got the devil in her heart)
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe

No, no, nay will she deceive
Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you

No, she's an angel sent to meBefore this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need

I've discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with youAll through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night

Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you
(Bop, bop cat bop)
(Go, Johnny, go)
(Them ol' 12-bar blues)
(Elmore James got nothing on this, baby)
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me and that's all you had to do

I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm livin' the bluesThere's a fog upon L.A
And my friends have lost their way
"We'll be over soon", they said
Now they've lost themselves instead
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
For I may be asleep
Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
For I may be asleep
Now it's past my bed I know (Know)
And I'd really like to go (Go)
Soon will be the break of day (Day)
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way (Way)

Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be longI don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know
I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her
Though I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Went out last night, I didn't stay late
Before I got home I had nineteen dates
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Went out last night, I didn't stay late
Before I got home I had nineteen dates
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, nowWe were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and howHere comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling, the smile's returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all rightBecause the world is round, it turns me on
Because the world is round
Because the wind is high, it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blueIf you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one thereIt's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea
It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
Ah, it's too much
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much, ah
We all get too much
Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too muchI look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(I look) Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oohHave you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
One more timeIt's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you?
It took a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you
So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you?
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love youCreme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's Good News
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down the blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's Good News
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffleGive me, uh, plenty of that guitar
For I've been travelling on a boat and a plane
In a car, on a bike, with a bus and a train
Travelling there, travelling here
Everywhere in every gear
But, oh Lord, we pay the price
With the spin of the wheel, with the roll of the dice
Ah yeah, you pay your fare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
And I've been travelling through the dirt and the grime
From the past to the future, through the space and the time
Travelling deep beneath the waves
In watery grottoes and mountainous caves
But, oh Lord, we've got to fight
With the thoughts in the head, with the dark and the light
No use to stop and stare
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
You may not know where you came from
May not know who you are
May not have even wondered
How you got this far
I've been travelling on a wing and a prayer
By the skin of my teeth, by the breadth of a hair
Travelling where the four winds blow
With the sun on my face, in the ice and the snow
But, ooh wee, it's a game
Sometimes you're cool, sometimes you're lame
Ah yeah, it's somewhere
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
But, oh Lord, we pay the price
With the spin of the wheel with the roll of the dice
Ah yeah, you pay your fare
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
I keep travelling around the bend
There was no beginning, there is no end
It wasn't born and never dies
There are no edges, there is no sides
Oh yeah, you just don't win
It's so far out, the way out is in
Bow to God and call him Sir
But if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
And if you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you thereGazed at the ceiling from below
A splendid Michelangelo
Filled my heart with delight
Last Saturday night
Arrived believing from home
Climbed every step inside St. Peter's Dome
Claustrophobic and ex-Catholic
Last Saturday night
Now how come nobody really noticed
Puff of white smoke knocked me out
The truth is hiding, lurking, banking
Things they do at night
It's quite suspicious to say the least
Even mentioned it to my local priest
One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night
I wish somebody would tell me
That it's only a show
And I'll confess, own up, let's face it
In my concrete tuxedo
It's quite suspicious to say the least
While mentioning it to my priest
One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night
One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday night
One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday nightRowers gliding on the river
Canadian geese crap along the bank
Back wheel of my bike begins to quiver
The chain is wrapped around the crank
Old ladies, who must be doggie training
Walking, throwing balls, chasing all the sheep
While the farmer stands around and he's complaining
His mad cows are being put to sleep
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul
Smoke signals from the brewery
Like someone in there found the latest Pope
In a vat of beer that keeps pumping out with fury
While the church bell ringer's tangled in his rope
But there's a temple on an island
I think of all the Gods and what they feel
You can only find them in the deepest silence
I've got to get off of this big wheel
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul
And I'll be swimming until I can find those waters
That's the one unbounded ocean of bliss
That's flowing through your parents, sons and daughters
But still an easy thing for us to miss
Blades go skimming through the water
I hear the coxswain shouting his instructions about
With this crew oh, it could be a tall order
Have we time to sort all these things out?
Sometimes my life it feels like fiction
Some of the days it's really quite serene
I'm a living proof of all life's contradictions
One half's going where the other half's just been
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soulOh Lord, won't you listen to me now?
Oh love, I got to get me back to you somehow
I never knew that life was loaded
I'd only hung around birds and bees
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life, looking for my life
Oh boy, you've no idea what I've been through
Oh love, I feel so stuck that I can't get to you
Had no idea that I was heading
Toward a state of emergency
I had no fear where I was treading
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life
Caught up on me with intensity
Had no idea where I was heading
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life, looking for my life
Oh boys, you've no idea what I've been through
Oh love, I got to get back somehow to you
I never knew that life was loaded
I'd only hung around birds and bees
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life
I never got any G.C.E.s
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life, looking for my lifeOn the street of villains taken for a ride
You can have the devil as a guide
And crippled by the boundaries, programmed into guilt
Until your nervous system starts to tilt
And in the room of mirrors you can see for miles
But everything that's there is in disguise
Every word you've uttered and every thought you've had
Is all inside your file, the good and the bad
But in the rising sun
You can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
And you're a billion years old today
Oh the rising sun
And the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun
On the avenue of sinners I have been employed
Working there until I was near destroyed
I was almost a statistic inside a doctor's case
When I heard the messenger from the inner space
He was sending me a signal that for so long I had ignored
But he held on to my umbilical cord
Until the ghost of memory trapped in my body, mind
Came out of hiding to become alive
And in the rising sun
You can hear your life begin
And it's here and there, nowhere and everywhere
Though its atmosphere is rare
Oh the rising sun
And the place that it's coming from
Is inside of me and now I feel it constantly
Oh the rising sun, oh the rising sun
Never slept so little, never smoked so much
Lost my concentration, I could even lose my touch
Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud
Well I made some exhibition, I lost my will to eat
The only thing that matters to me is to touch your lotus feet
Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud
Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud
Talking to myself, crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside a cloud
Never been so crazy but I've never felt so sure
I wish I had the answer to give, don't even have the cure
Just talking to myself, crying as we part
Knowing as you leave me, I also lose my heart
I'm talking to myself and I'm crying as we part
Knowing as you leave me, I also lose my heartYou fly out as your smile wears thin
I sigh knowing the mess you're in
And you know that you can't get away
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself
Lonely days, blue guitar
There's no escape, can only run so far
I know something I oughta say
Stuck here, trying to find a way
And you know that you can't get away
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself
Lonely nights, traveling far
There's no escape, can only run so far
Lonesome tears, after dark
There's no escape, can only run so far
I know I'll never get over you
So deep this feeling I have for you
Your eyes pierce through my heart
Your smile tears me apart
I knew it, it's so true
I'll never get over you
You touch me making my heart race
So much was written on your face
I knew when you arrived
That no words could describe
What your love made me do
I'll never get over you
Girl, you're so much heart and soul
Girl, was a moonlit night
You came into my life
And now this feeling has grown
And if you leave me alone I know
I'll never get over you
So hide the moments when I feel blue
You warm the coldest feet
Can cool me in the heat
And although love was new
I'll never get over you
My understanding grew
But I'll never get over
Never get over you
You, youI don't want you but I hate to lose you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you because I can't forget you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I want to cross you off my list
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you but I guess I love you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I want to cross you off my list
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you but I guess, I love you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
You got me in between the devil and the deep
The devil and the deep blue seaI'm going down to the river
Going to take me my rocking chair
Going down to the river
Going to take me my rocking chair
And if those blues don't leave me
Going to rock on away from here
If you want me woman
Please don't act so shy
And if you want me woman
Please don't pass me by
I love those sideways glances
Your shoulder and your thigh
I see inside your eyes
The Baba's Sai
The reasons why I love you
So if you're still busy hiding
What it is you've got?
And if you're frightened of losing
When you like a lot
You may be cruising backwards
While thinking that you're not
So if you don't get the picture
You won't know what I feel
If you don't get the picture
Then you won't have a depth of field
You may be going someplace
Some place you've already beenBrainwashed in our childhood
Brainwashed by the school
Brainwashed by our teachers
And brainwashed by all their rules
Brainwashed by our leaders
By our kings and queens
Brainwashed in the open
And brainwashed behind the scenes
God, God, God
A voice cried in the wilderness
God, God, God
It was on the longest night
God, God, God
An eternity of darkness
God, God, God
Someone turned out the spiritual light
Brainwashed by the Nikkei
And brainwashed by Dow Jones
Brainwashed by the FTSE
Nasdaq and secure loans
Brainwashed us from Brussels
Brainwashing us in Bonn
Brainwashing us in Washington
Westminster in London
God, God, God
You are the wisdom that we seek
God, God, God
The lover that we miss
God, God, God
Your nature is eternity
God, God, God
You are Existence, Knowledge, Bliss
The soul does not love, it is love itself
It does not exist, it is existence itself
It does not know, it is knowledge itself
'How to Know God' Page 130
They brainwashed my great uncle
Brainwashed my cousin Bob
They even got my grandma
When she was working for the mob
Brainwash you while you're sleeping
While in your traffic jam
Brainwash you while you're weeping
While still a baby in your pram
Brainwashed by the military
Brainwashed under duress
Brainwashed by the media
You're brainwashed by the press
Brainwashed by computer
Brainwashed by mobile phones
Brainwashed by the satellite
Brainwashed to the bone
God, God, God
Won't You lead us through this mess
God, God, God
From the places of concrete
God, God, God
Nothing's worse than ignorance
God, God, God
I just won't accept defeat
God, God, God
Must be something I forgot
God, God, God
Down on Bullshit Avenue
God, God, God
If we can only stop the rot
God, God, God
Wish that you'd brainwash us too

I thought I'd take a sip
Came off the rails so crazy
My senses took a dip
Before the bottle hit the floor
And I'd had time to think
I was blinded by desire
The elephant turned pink
The rest is simply shady
It's all been done before
But it doesn't make life easy
That's for sure
You may think about a lady
Cause yourself a minor war
And your life won't be so easy anymore
No sooner had I sown it
When I began to reap
I was torn from shallow water
And plunged into the deep
And as I started drowning
I clung onto a straw
That somehow kept me floating
While my madness craved for more
Now the rest is simply shady
It's all been done and more
But it doesn't make life simple
That's for sure
You may think about a lady
Let her in through your front door
But your life won't be so easy anymore
A pebble in the ocean
Must've caused some kind of stir
And witnessed by the silence
Will reach from here to there
The action that I've started
Sometime I'll have to face
My influence in motion
Rebounding back through space
Now the rest is simply shady
It's all been done before
But it doesn't make life easy
That's for sure
You may think you're Sexy Sadie
Let her in through your front door
But your life won't be so easy anymore
Cause yourself a minor war
But your life won't be so easy anymore
You may think you're Sexy Sadie
Let her in through your front door
But your life won't be so easy anymoreNow the winter has come
To eclipse out the sun
That has lighted my love for sometime
And a cold wind now blows
Not much tenderness flows
From the heart of someone feeling so tired
And he feels so alone
With no love of his own
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad
While his memory raced
With much speed and great haste
Through the problems of being there
In his heart at arm's length
Held within its great strength
To ward off such a great despair
But he feels so alone
With no love of his own
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad
Take the dawn of the day
And give it away
To someone who can fill the part
Of the dream we once held
Now it's got to be shelved
It's too late to make a new start
But he feels so alone
With no love of his own
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad
Oh so sad, so bad, oh so sad, so bad
So sad, so badBye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I know I'm gonna die
Goodbye my love bye bye
There goes our lady with a "you know who"
I hope she's happy and "old 'Clapper' too
We had good rhythm (and a little slide)
Then she stepped in
Did me a favour, I threw them both out
Goodbye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye my love bye bye
Bye bye love
It's gonna be a raining out of doors
Hello happiness
Goodbye my love goodbye
Now I'm into romance
I shy away from love
Got tired of ladies that plot and shove me
And that's the reason
We all can see so clearly
They see that our lady is out on a spree
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna, think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello emptiness
I think I'm gonna cry
Goodbye my love, goodbye
Goodbye my lovers, goodbye
Goodbye my loveMaya love, maya love
Maya love is like the sea
Flowing in and out of me
Maya love, maya love
Maya love is like the day
First it comes, then it rolls away
Maya love, maya love
Maya love is like the wind
Blowing hard on everything
Maya love, maya love
Maya love is like the rain
Beating on your window brain
Maya love, maya love
Maya love is like the stream

Baby it looks like he fooling you again
You thought that you had got me all staked out
Baby it looks like I've been breaking out
I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Just looking for the source
I'm a dark horse
You thought that you had got me in your grip
Baby looks like you was not so smart
And I became too slippery for you
But let me tell ya that was nothing new
I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I picked up my first spoon
I've been a cool jerk
Just looking for the source
I'm a dark horse
I thought that you knew it all along
Until you started getting me not right
Seems as if you heard a little late
I warned you when we both was at the starting gate
I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Who's looking for his perks
I'm a dark horse
I'm a dark horse
I'm running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped right out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Just looking at the source
I'm a dark horseWhile the world wages war
It gets harder to see
Who your friends really are
I won't let him down
Got to do what I can
I can't let him drown
He's a far east man
All these ups and those downs
Makes me question what love is
Is it a lie or worthwhile
I can't let him down
Got to do what I can
I can't let him drown
He's a far east man
Sometimes is so short but it takes so long
Wondering if it is or if I'm wrong
Even then my heart seems to be the one in charge
Can only do what it tells me
We can't let them down
We got to do what we can
We can't let them drown
He's a far east man
Looks like right here on earth
God, it's hellish at times
I feel that a heaven's in sight
I can't let him down
Gonna do what I can
I can't let him drown
He's a far east manJai krishna jai krishna krishna

I don't care anymore (more juice on the phones)
And I'll kick down anybody's door
To hold you in my arms once more
I'd go anywhere
Y'know I don't care
If your man should get uptight
'Cause we've been alone for most of the night
Now realize your needs alright
Now get back up them stairs
Y'know I don't care
There's a line I can draw
That often leaves me wanting more
But it's not so often that I feel so sure
There's nothing I can do
To stop me falling more in love with you
Now, It can't be so bad
What you want that you do not have
It's likely to upset your dad
I don't think it's unfair
Y'know I don't care
Anymore
And I'll kick down anybody's door
To hold you in my arms once more
I'd go anywhere
Y'know I don't careLet me in here, I know I've been here
Let me into your heart
Let me know you, let me show you
Let me roll it to you

Let me lay it on you
Let me know you, let me show you
Let me grow upon you

You've given me a wah-wah
And I'm thinking of you
And all the things that we used to do
Wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah
You made me such a big star
Being there at the right time
Cheaper than a dime
Wah-wah, you've given me your wah-wah, wah-wah
Oh, you don't see me crying
Oh, you don't hear me sighing
Wah-wah
I don't need no wah-wah
And I know how sweet life can be
If I keep myself free from the wah-wah
I don't need no wah-wah
Oh, you don't see me crying
Hey baby, you don't hear me sighing
Oh, no no-no no
Wah-wah
Now I don't need no wah-wah's
And I know how sweet life can be
If I keep myself free - of wah-wah
I don't need no wah-wah
Wah-wah (repeat and fade)Isn't it a pity?
Now, isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?
Some things take so long, but how do I explain
When not too many people can see we're all the same
And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see the beauty that surrounds them
Isn't it a pity?
Isn't it a pity?
Isn't is a shame?
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?
Forgetting to give back
Now, isn't it a pity?

But my love is there for you anytime of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed
Tell me, what is my life without your love?
Tell me, who am I without you by my side?
What I know, I can do
If I give my love now to everyone like you
But if it's not love that you need

Oh tell me, what is my life without your love?
Tell me, who am I without you by my side?If not for you
Babe, I couldn't even find the door
I couldn't even see the floor
I'd be sad and blue, if not for you
If not for you
Babe, the night would see me wide awake
The day would surely have to break
It would not be new, if not for you
If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather, too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
I would be lost, if not for you
If not for you
The winter would hold no spring
Couldn't hear a robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you
If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather, too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
I would be lost, if not for you
If not for you
The winter would hold no spring
Couldn't hear a robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue, if not for youWhy are you still crying?
Your pain is now through
Please forget those teardrops
Let me take them from you
The love you are blessed with
This world's waiting for
So let out your heart please, please
From behind that locked door
It's time we start smiling
What else should we do?
With only this short time
I'm gonna be here with you
And the tales you have taught me
From the things that you saw
Makes me want out your heart, please, please
From behind that locked door
And if ever my love goes
If I'm rich or I'm poor
Please, let out my heart, please, please
From behind that locked door
From behind that locked doorThough you sit in another chair, I can feel you here
Looking like I don't care, but I do, I do
Hiding it all behind anything I see
Should someone be looking at me
While I occupy my mind, I can feel you here
Love to us is so well timed, and I do, I do
Wasting away these moments so heavenly
Should someone be looking at me
Let it down, let it down
Let your hair hang all around me
Let it down, let it all down
Let your love flow and astound me
While you look so sweetly and divine, I can feel you here
I see your eyes are busy kissing mine, and I do, I do
Wondering what it is they are expecting to see
Should someone be looking at me
Let it down, let it down
Let your hair hang all around me
Let it down, let it all down
Let your love flow and astound me
Let it down, let it down, ooh
Let it down, let it down, ooh
Let it down, let it down, oohEveryone has choice
When to or not to raise their voices
It's you that decides
Which way you will turn
While feeling that our love's not your concern
It's you that decides
No one around you
Will carry the blame for you
No one around you
Will love you today and throw it all away
Tomorrow when you rise
Another day for you to realise me
Or send me down again
As the days stand up on end
You've got me wondering how I lost your friendship
But I see it in your eyes
Though I'm beside you
I can't carry the blame for you
I may decide to
Get out with your blessing
Where I'll carry on guessing
How high will you leap
Will you make enough for you to reap it?
Only you'll arrive
At your own made end
With no one but yourself to be offended
It's you that decidesWatch out now, take care
Beware of falling swingers
Dropping all around you
The pain that often mingles in your fingertips
Beware of darkness
Watch out now, take care
Beware of the thoughts that linger
Winding up inside your head
The hopelessness around you
In the dead of night
Beware of sadness
It can hit you
It can hurt you
Make you sore and what is more
That is not what you are here for
Watch out now, take care
Beware of soft shoe shufflers
Dancing down the sidewalks
As each unconscious sufferer
Wanders aimlessly
Beware of Maya
Watch out now, take care
Beware of greedy leaders
They take you where you should not go
While Weeping Atlas Cedars
They just want to grow, grow and grow
Beware of darkness (beware of darkness)Now I've watched you sitting there
Seen the passers-by all stare
Like you have no place to go
But there's so much they don't know about Apple Scruffs
You've been stood around for years
Seen my smiles and touched my tears
How it's been a long, long time
And how you've been on my mind, my Apple Scruffs
Apple Scruffs, Apple Scruffs
How I love you, how I love you
In the fog and in the rain
Through the pleasures and the pain
On the step outside you stand
With your flowers in your hand, my Apple Scruffs
While the years they come and go
Now, your love must surely show me
That beyond all time and space
We're together face to face, my Apple Scruffs
Apple Scruffs, Apple Scruffs
How I love you, how I love youLet it roll across the floor
Through the hall and out the door
To the fountain of perpetual mirth
Let it roll for all it's worth
Find me where ye echo lays
Lose ye bodies in the maze
See the Lord and all the mouths he feeds
Let it roll among the weeds
Let it roll
Let it roll down through the caves
Ye long walks of Coole and Shades
Through ye woode, here may ye rest awhile
Handkerchiefs to match your tie
Let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
Fools illusions everywhere
Joan and Molly sweeps the stairs
Eyes that shining full of inner light
Let it roll into the night
Let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll, let it rollYou don't need no love in
You don't need no bed pan
You don't need a horoscope or a microscope
To see the mess that you're in
If you open up your heart
You will know what I mean
We've been polluted so long
Now here's a way for you to get clean
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
You don't need no passport
And you don't need no visas
You don't need to designate or to emigrate
Before you can see Jesus
If you open up your heart
You'll see He's right there
Always was and will be
He'll relieve you of your cares
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
You don't need no church house
And you don't need no Temple
You don't need no rosary beads or them books to read
To see that you have fallen
If you open up your heart
You will know what I mean
We've been kept down so long
Someone's thinking that we're all green
And while the Pope owns 51% of General Motors
And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be freeSunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always going to be this gray
All things must pass
All things must pass away
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always going to be this gray
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way and face another day
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this gray
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass awayI dig love
I dig love
I dig love
Hmm, I dig love in the morning
I dig love in the evening
I dig love and I want you to know I dig love
I love dig
I love dig
I love dig
Hmm, I love dig in the morning
I love dig every evening
I dig love and I want you to know I dig love
Small love, big love, I don't care
Love's all good love to me
Left love, right love, anywhere love
There's a rare love, come on and get it, it's free
I dig love

Hmm, I dig love in the morning
I dig love in the evening

Try to live love, come on that's where you should be

You know I dig love—yes I do

I dig loveThere'll come a time when all of us must leave here
There's nothing sister Mary can do
Will keep me here with you
As nothing in this life that I've been trying
Can equal or surpass the art of dying
Do you believe me?
There'll come a time when all your hopes are fading
When things that seemed so very plain
Become an awful pain
Searching for the truth among the lying
And answered when you've learned the art of dying
Are you still with me?
But if you want it
Then you must find it
But when you have it
There'll be no need for it
There'll come a time when most of us return here
Brought back by our desire to be
A perfect entity
Living through a million years of crying
Until you've realized the art of dying
Can you believe me?Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity
Some things take so long
But how do I explain
When not too many people
Can see we're all the same
And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them
Now, isn't it a pity
Now isn't it a pity
Oh, now isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Now isn't it a pity(Hear me Lord)
Forgive me Lord
Please, those years when I ignored you, hmm
Forgive them Lord
Those that feel they can't afford you, hmm
Help me Lord, please
To rise above this dealing, hmm
Help me Lord, please
To love you with more feeling, hmm
At both ends of the road
To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in, there's no place that you're not in
Oh, won't you hear me Lord
(Hear me Lord)
(Hear me Lord)

At both ends of the road
To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in, there's no place that you're not in
Oh, won't you hear me Lord
Help me Lord, please
To rise a little higher, hmm
Help me Lord, please
To burn out this desire, hmm
Hear me Lord, please

Not a care for this world have I
Only you keep my eyes open wide
Yes it's true
I live for you
Not a thing in this world do I own
Only sadness from all that is grown
In this darkness, I wait for the day
Yes it's true
I live for you

For many tears I wait
All this time my thoughts return to you
Give my love, that is all I can do
Wait in line 'til I feel you inside

There's no easy way out at all
Still it only takes time
Till love comes to everyone
For you who it always seems blue
It all comes, it never rains  but it pours
Still it only takes time
Till love comes to everyone
There in your heart
Something that's never changing
Always a part of
Something that's never aging
That's in your heart
It's so true it can happen to you all, there
Knock and it will open wide
And it only takes time
'Til love comes to everyone
There in your heart
Something that's never changing
Always a part of
Something that's never aging
That's in your heart
It's so true it can happen to you all, there
Knock and it will open wide
And it only takes time
'Til love comes to everyone
It only takes time
'Til love comes to everyone
Love comes to everyone

There in your heart
Something that's never changing
Always a part of
Something that's never aging
It's in your heartNot guilty
Of getting in your way
While you're trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I'm not here for the rest
I'm not trying to steal your vest
I am not trying to be smart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your ageing head
But like you heard me said
I'm not guilty
Not guilty
For being on your street
Getting underneath your feet
Not guilty
No use handing me a writ
While I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your heart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed
But like you heard me said
I'm not guilty
Not guilty
For looking like a freak
Making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray
On the road to Mandalay
I won't upset the apple cart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been misled
But like you heard me said
I'm not guiltyEverybody's talking up a storm
Act like they don't noticed it
But here it is and here it comes
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Oh yeah
Impulse always quickens when it's full
As it turns my head around me
Yes it does, and here it comes
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Oh yeah
God's gift I see that's moving up there into the night
Though dark, the mirror in the sky reflects us our light
Looks like a little brother to the sun
Or mother to the stars at night
And here it is and here it comes
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Oh yeah
Breath is always taken when it's new
Enhance upon the clouds around it
Yes it is, and here it comes
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon
Oh yeahI ate it and at once my eyes could see you
No sooner had I ooped it down
I felt so far off from the ground I stood on
My legs they seemed to me like high-rise buildings
My head was high up in the sky
My skin the sun began to fry like bacon
And then somebody old appeared and asked had I come far
And hadn't they just seen me up on Haleakala
I kept on body surfing to pretend I hadn't heard
There was someone there beside me, swimming like Richard III
And I'm still smiling
Seven naked native girls swam seven sacred pools
Lone ranger smoking doobies said you're breaking all the rules
You'd better get your clothes on or else there'll be a row
If it wasn't for my sunstroke I would take you on right now
And I'm still smiling
I fell in love with my soft-hearted Hana
She entered right in through my heart
And now although we're miles apart
I still feel her
She lives beneath the crater in the meadow
She grows among the fruit and grain
You can meet her after heavy rain has fallenDay turned black, sky ripped apart
Rained for a year until it dampened my heart
Cracks and leaks
The floorboards caught rot
About to go down
I had almost forgot
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
Sky cleared up, day turned to bright
Closing both eyes now the head filled with light
Hard to remember what a state I was in
Instant amnesia
Yang to the Yin
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
Wind blew in, cloud was dispersed
Rainbows appearing, the pressures were burst
Breezes a-singing, now feeling good
The moment had passed
Like I knew that it should
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away
All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow awayChose a life in circuses
Jumped into the deepest end
Pushing himself to all extremes
Made it, people became his friend
Now they stood and noticed him
Wanted to be a part of it
Pulled out some poor machinery
So he worked till the pieces fit
The people were intrigued
His wife held back her fears
The headlines gave acclaim
He'd realized their dreams
Faster than a bullet from a gun
He is faster than everyone
Quicker than the blinking of an eye
Like a flash you could miss him going by
No one knows quite how he does it but it's true they say
He's the master of going faster
Now he moved into the space
That the special people share
Right on the edge of do or die
Where there is nothing left to spare
Still the crowds came pouring in
Some had hoped to see him fail
Filling their hearts with jealousies
Crazy people with love so frail
The people were intrigued
His wife held back her fears
The headlines gave acclaim
He'd realized their dreams
Faster than a bullet from a gun
He is faster than everyone
Quicker than the blinking of an eye
Like a flash you could miss him going by
No one knows quite how he does it but it's true they say
He's the master of going faster
No need to wonder why
His wife held back her fears
So few have even tried
To realize their dreams
Faster than a bullet from a gun
He is faster than everyone
Quicker than the blinking of an eye
Like a flash you could miss him going by
No one knows quite how he does it but it's true they say
He's the master of going faster
No one knows quite how he does it but it's true they say
He's the master of going fasterMy dark sweet lady
You really got to me
You gave me everything
I've really fallen
You came and helped me through
When I'd let go
You came from out the blue
Never have known what I'd done without you
My dark sweet lady
Your heart so close to mine
You shine so heavenly
And I love you dearly
You came and helped me through
When I'd let go
You came from out the blue
Never have known what I'd done without you
My dark sweet lady
Your heart so close to mine
You shine so heavenly
And I love you dearly
My dark sweet ladySublime is the summertime, warm and lazy
These are perfect days like Heaven's about here
But unlike summer came and went
Your love is forever
I feel it and my heart knows
That we share it together
Resigned to the wintertime's cold and dreary
Peering into fire's flames, burning I know
That unlike winter came and went
Your love is forever
I feel it and my heart knows
That we share it together
I feel it and my heart knows you're the one
The guiding light in all your love shines on
The only lover worth it all
Your love is forever
But unlike summer that came and went
Your love is forever
I feel it and my heart knows
That we share it together
The only lover worth it all
Your love is foreverYou're a soft touch baby like a snowflake falling
My whole heart is melting
As a warm sun rises into joy I'm sailing
To your soft touch baby
Eyes that shine from depths of your soul
Fixed by their charm, take my control
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side
As a cool wind blows me all the treetops whisper
To your soft touch baby
As a new moon rises those ideas of heaven
Fall in your soft touch baby
Eyes that shine from depths of your soul
Fixed by their charm, take my control
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side
You're a soft touch baby like a snowflake falling
My whole heart is melting
As a warm sun rises into joy I'm sailing
To your soft touch baby
You're a soft touch baby
Yes I love that soft touch
That soft touch
You're a soft touch baby
Yes I love that soft touchYou can worry your life away with
Not knowing what each new day may bring to you
Or take each day as it goes on
Wake up to the love that flows on around you
If you believe
If you believe in you
Everything you thought is possible if you believe
If you believe in me
All your love's reflected back when you believe
Too many troubles you can't control
To get you falling into the holes they dig for you
Get up - you have all your needs, pray
Give up and it all recedes away from you
If you believe
If you believe in you
Everything you thought is possible if you believe
If you believe in me
All your love's reflected back to you If you believe
If you believe in you
Everything you hoped is true if you believe
If you believe in me
All your love's reflected back
If you believe
If you believe in you
Everything you thought is possible, if you believeI'm going to leave you here
I'm going to leave you at the station
I've got a long way to go, baby
Woman don't you cry for me
Now I can't take no more
Now I don't need no complication
I've got a long way to go, baby
Woman don't you cry for me
There's no one place I want to be
Attachment only hurts me
Take care of yourself, baby
Come on won't you let me be
There's just one thing I got to see
That's the Lord got to keep Him in sight
Take care of yourself, baby
Come on won't you let me be
There's no one place I want to be
Attachment only hurts you
Take care of yourself, baby
Come on won't you try to see
There is just one thing I got to see
That's the Lord got to keep Him in sight
Better take care of yourself, baby
Come on won't you let me be
Now baby here's the door
I don't need no aggravation
I've got a long way to go, baby
Woman don't you cry for me
I'm going to leave you here
I'm going to leave you at the station
I've got a long way to go, baby
Woman don't you cry for me
I've got a long way to go, baby
Woman don't you cry for meDear one, near me, truth assessed
Reborn world wise, mind at rest
True heart sow you, God has blessed

You see creation at your feet
You feel my feelings calling you

Dear one, I love you
You hear my spirit sing to you
You see creation at your feet
You feel my feelings calling you
You know, dear one, I love youNever seen such a beautiful girl
Got me shaking inside
Calling on me from deep within her eyes
Not the kind you go handing around
Want to keep her right there
But this love, it don't come as no surprise
And when I saw the way that she smiled at me
I knew it there and then that she was A-1
And then I felt the way she was touching me
Was something I had known, I was waiting upon
Never seen such a beautiful girl
Had me quickly untied
Calling to me she made me realize
Not the kind that is lost or is found
She has always been there
A lover needed for this soul to survive
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
And when I saw the way that she smiled at me
I knew it there and then that she was A-1
And when I felt the way she got through to me
Was something, I had known, I was waiting upon
Never seen such a beautiful girl
Got me shaking inside
Calling on me from deep within her eyes
Not the kind you go handing around
Want to keep her right there
But this love, it don't come as no surprise
Ooh ooh
Ooh oohThis song has nothing tricky about it
This song ain't black or white and as far as I know
Don't infringe on anyone's copyright, so
This song, we'll let be, this song is in E
This song is for you and
This tune has nothing bright about it
This tune ain't bad or good and come ever what may
My expert tells me it's okay
As this song came to me unknowingly
This song could be, you could be
("Could be 'Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch' – No, sounds more like 'Rescue Me'!")
This riff ain't trying to win gold medals
This riff ain't hip or square, well done or rare
May end up one more weight to bear
But this song could well be
A reason to see that
Without you, there's no point to this song
But this song could well be
A reason to see that
Without you, there's no point to this songIt's easier to tell a lie than it is to tell the truth
It's easier to kill a fly than it is to turn it loose
It's easier to criticize somebody else
Than to see yourself
It's easier to give a sigh and be like all the rest
Who stand around and crucify you while you do your best
It's easier to see the books upon the shelf
Than to see yourself
It's easier to hurt someone and make them cry
Than it is to dry their eyes
I got tired of fooling around with other people's lies
Rather I'd find someone that's true
It's easier to say, you won't than it is to feel you can
It's easier to drag your feet than it is to be a man
It's easier to look at someone else's wealth
Than to see yourself, ooh ooh
To see yourself
It's easier to see the books upon the shelf
Than to see yourself, ooh ooh
It's easier to criticize somebody else
Than to see yourself
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oohSomeone's driving a 450
And his friends are so wild
They're still in their stick shifties
But they feel they have much more style
But I've found
It's all up to what you value
Down to where you are
It all swings on the pain you've gone through
Getting where you are
It's all up to what you value
In your motor car
It all rests on what it cost you
Getting where you are
It's what you value
Someone's driving a 6-wheeler
Seems the world is all blurred
Knows he's in a show stealer
With a sound that's uncompared
But I've found
It's all up to what you value
Down to where you are
It all swings on the pain you've gone through
Getting where you are
It's all up to what you value
In your motor car
It all rests on what it cost you
Getting where you are
It's what you value
And I've found, I've found
It's all up to what you value
Down to where you are
It all swings on the pain you've gone through
Getting where you are
It's all up to what you value
In your motor car
It all rests on what it cost you
Getting where you are
It's what you valueYou give to me and I give to you
True love, it's a true love
And on and on, it will always be
True love, true love
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to me and to give to you
A love, forever true
It's a love, forever true
True love, it's a true love
True love, true love
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to me and to give to you
A love, forever true
A love, forever true
It's a love, forever trueSmokey, Smokey
Throughout my lifetimes, I'd hesitate
I'd feel some joy
But before I'd show my thanks
It became too late, ooh
But now all the way
I want to find the time and stop to say
I want to thank you Lord
For giving us each new day
And thinking back over so many years
Love that's filled my ears
I want to thank you Lord
For giving us pure Smokey, ooh ooh
And anyone who hears that voice so free
He really got a hold on me
And I thank you Lord
For giving to us pure Smokey, pure Smokey
Smokey, pure Smokey
(Thank you Lord)
He's singing it so sweetly like no one else could do
Always trying something new
And I thank you Lord
For giving us pure Smokey
And anyone who hears, hears that voice so free
He really got a hold on me
And I thank you Lord
For giving to us pure Smokey, Smokey
Ooh ooh
Thank you LordI was so young when I was born
My eyes could not yet see
And by the time of my first dawn
Somebody holding me they said
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace
We've been expecting you
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true
While growing up or trying to
Not knowing where to start
I looked around for someone who
May help reveal my heart - someone said
While you're a part of Crackerbox Palace
Do what the rest all do
Or face the fact that Crackerbox Palace
May have no other choice than to deport you
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace
We've been expecting you
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true
It's twoo, it's twoo
Some times are good, some times are bad
That's all a part of life
And standing in between them all
I met a Mr. Grief - and he said
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace
Was not expecting you
Let's rap and tap at Crackerbox Palace
Know that the Lord is well and inside of you
And we, welcome you to Crackerbox Palace
We've been expecting you
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace
No matter where you roam know our love, know our love is trueWhile all is still in the night
And silence starts its flow
Become or disbelieve me
Left alone with my heart
I'm learning how to love you
While waiting on the light
How patience learned to grow
Endeavor could relieve me
Left alone with my heart
I know that I can love you
Love you like you may have never been
Move you more ways than you have seen
To a point in the time where we see so much more
Than the ground that we touch
With each step so unsure
As teardrops cloud the sight
Your eyes may never know
No truth could ever fear me
Left alone with my heart
Learning how to love you
Love you like you may have never seen
Move you more ways than you have been
To a point in the time where we see so much more
Than the ground that we touch
With each step so unsure
As teardrops cloud the sight
Your eyes may never know
No truth could ever fear me
I'm left alone with my heart
Learning how to love youWar mongers terrorize us all
Our leaders heed us to the call
Stonewalling, voices calling
Drowning in the tears of the world
Big business calling every tune
Polluting here and to the moon
All nations, conservations
Drowning in the tears of the world
But your life's worth saving
We should start behaving
Like the truth's been told
By saviors through our time
Your downfall, you bring it on yourselves
All warnings fall upon deaf ears
Their scorn compounding my worst fears
No way out, hopeless souls shout
Drowning in the tears of the world
Drowning in the tears of the world
Tears of the world
Where's your love been sleeping?
Has your heart been weeping
Over all unrighteous action in the world
Where bad jazz seems all they're laying down?
No use in turning your blind eye
You feel the heat as you fry
Try your best, you'll find no rest
Drowning in the tears of the world
It's a sure bet, each pays his debts
Drowning in the tears of the worldI, I, love, love
And I, and I love you
Oh you, you, yeah you
And you, you, love, love
And you, yes you, you love me
Yeah you, you, yeah you
And when I'm holding you
What a feeling
Seems so good to be true
That I'm telling you all
That I must be dreaming
And I, and I, I love you
Oh you, oh oh you, yeah you
And when I'm holding you
What a feeling
Seems so good to be true
I'm telling you all
I must be dreaming
I, oh I, love, love
And I, yeah I, I love you
I love you, oh you
You, oh you
You, oh oh oh
You know that I love you, oh oh oh
You know that I love youScan not a friend with a microscopic glass
You know his faults, now let his foibles pass
Life is one long enigma, my friend
So read on, read on, the answer's at the end
Don't be so hard on the ones that you love
It's the ones that you love we think so little of
Don't be so hard on the ones that you need
It's the ones that you need we think so little of
The speech of flowers it excels the flowers of speech
But what's often in your heart is the hardest thing to reach
And life is one long mystery, my friend
So live on, live on, the answer's at the end
Don't be so hard on the ones that you love
It's the ones that you love we think so little of
Don't be so hard on the ones that you need
It's the ones that you need we think so little of
Don't be so hard on the ones that you love
It's the ones that you love we think so little of
Oh, we think so little of the ones that we love, sometimes
Isn't it a pity how we hurt the ones that we love the most of all
The ones we shouldn't hurt at all
You know my faults, now let the foibles pass
'Cause life is one long enigma, my friend
Live on, live on, the answer's at the end
Don't be so hard on the ones that you love
It's the ones that you love we think so little of
Don't be so hard on the ones that you need
It's the ones that you need we think so little of
Don't be so hard on the ones that you love
It's the ones that you love we think so little of
Don't be so hard on the ones that you need
It's the ones that you need we think so little of
The ones that we love we hurt the most of all, sometimes
And isn't it a pity how we hurt the ones that we love(one, two, three, four)
Found myself out on a limb
But I'm happier than I've ever been
But this guitar can't keep from crying
Learned to get up when I fall
Can even climb Rolling Stone walls
But this guitar can't keep from crying
This here guitar can feel quite sad
Can be high strung, sometimes gets mad
Can't understand or deal with hate
Responds much better to love
I thought by now you knew the score
You missed the point just like before
But this guitar can't keep from crying
This guitar it can't keep from crying
This guitar can't keep from crying
This here guitar can feel quite sad
Can be high strung, sometimes gets mad
It can't understand or deal with hate
Responds much better to love
While you attack, create offence
I'll put it down to your ignorance
But this guitar it can't keep from crying

The sun came into view
As I sat with the tears in my eyes
The sun came up on you
And as you smiled, the teardrop, it dried
Don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home alone with you
Tired of midnight blue
The sun came up so high
And as it shone, I realized your love
The sun shone in your eyes
And as you smiled, you realized it too
Don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you
Tired of midnight blue
I don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you
Tired of midnight blue
The sun went down the sky
Way up the clouds told me that they knew
The moon came up so high
And as you smiled, I knew that you knew too
Don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you
Tired of midnight blue
Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you

With a padlock on the night
Leave the battlefield behind
Stay out the fight
Not lose my sight
Now I only want to be
With no pistol at my brain
But at times it gets so lonely
Could go insane
Could lose my aim
Now I only want to live
With no teardrops in my eyes
But at times it feels like no chance
No clear blue skies
Grey cloudy lies
No clear blue skies
Grey cloudy lies(I'm not cheating)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Everything is Dinky Doo
Everything that you do
You, the king of La-Di-Da
Pretty very out far
Never oversits, he understands
Like the back of the hand
He should sing in a band, oh yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
People think he's Loopy Loo
And when they look at his shoes
He's a rocking sausage roll
He gets it in the goal
Healthy little brown affair
And when he washes his hair
He'll get around or square
Get them singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Everyone from Oxford town
Way down to the Rio Grande
Knows his harbour quays
His skin tight hands, without seggs
His name is Legs
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Coolies sweating in Hong Kong
Run along to the Mardi Grass
Risking Asian flu to meet the man
Who lays the eggs
His name is Legs
He's a cure for whooping cough
And if the going gets rough
Get lined up, come Sikh, come Czar
No matter who you are
We could get along and slide a rule
And if you don't play fools
While Larry plays pool
You'll hear him singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oohGive me love, give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light, give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope, help me cope
With this heavy load
Trying to touch and reach you with
Heart and soul
Om...
My Lord
Please take hold of my hand
That I might understand you
Won't you please, oh, won't you?
Give me love, give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light, give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope, help me cope
With this heavy load
Trying to, touch and reach you with
Heart and soul
Om...

Won't you please, oh, won't you?

Now give me hope and help me cope
With this heavy load
Trying to, touch and reach you with
Heart and soul
Om... My Lord...And you serve me and I'll serve you
Swing your partners, all get screwed
Bring your lawyer and I'll bring mine
Get together and we could have a bad time
It's affidavit swearing time
Sign it on the dotted line
Hold your Bible in your hand
Now all that's left is to find yourself a new band
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
Hold the block on money flow
I move it into joint escrow
Court receiver, laughs and thrills
But in the end we just pay those lawyers their bills
And you serve me and I'll serve you
Swing your partners, all get screwed
Bring your lawyer and I'll bring mine
Get together and we could have a bad time
We're going to play the sue me, sue you blues
Sue me, sue you blues
I'm tired of playing the sue me, sue you bluesI've heard how some people, have said that I've changed
That I'm not what I was, how it really is a shame
The thoughts in their heads manifest on their brow
Like bad scars from ill feelings tThey themselves arouse
So hateful of anyone that is happy or free
They live all their lives without looking to see
The light that has lighted the world
It's funny how people just won't accept change
As if nature itself they'd prefer re-arranged
So hard to move on when you're down in a hole
Where there's so little chance to experience soul
I'm grateful to anyone that is happy or free
For giving me hope while I'm looking to see
The light that has lighted the worldHow I love you baby
So don't let me wait too long
How I love you baby
So don't let me wait too long
How I love you baby
So don't let me wait too long
How I love you baby
So don't let me wait too long
When you're here by my side
Now only you know how to dry up
All of those tears that I've cried
Here with your love
Now only you know how to lay it down
Like it came from above
You know it's you that I love
Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long
When you're here by my side
Now only you know how to dry up
All of those tears that I've cried
Here, with your love
Now only you know how to lay it down
Like it came from above
You know it's you that I love
So don't let me wait too long
Ah don't let me wait too long
How I miss you baby
Baby, so don't let me wait too long
How I miss you baby
Baby, so don't let me wait
Don't let me wait
Don't let me wait too longI've been held up, I've been run down
I can see quite clearly now
Through those past years
When I played towing the line
I only ask, that what I feel
Should not be denied me now
As it's been earned, and I have seen
My life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it
I've lived in fear, I've been out there
I've been around and seen my share
Of this sad world and all the hate that it's stirred
I only ask that what I know
Should not be denied me now
As it's been learned and I have seen
My life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it
I only ask, that what I feel
Should not be denied me now
As it's been earned, and I have seen
My life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it
My love belongs to whoI'm living in the material world
Living in the material world
Can't say what I'm doing here
But I hope to see much clearer
After living in the material world
I got born into the material world
Getting worn out in the material world
Use my body like a car
Taking me both near and far
Met my friends all in the material world
Met them all here in the material world
John and Paul here in the material world
Though we started out quite poor
We got Richie on a tour
Got caught up in the material world
From the spiritual sky
Such sweet memories have I
To the spiritual sky
How I pray
Yes I pray
That I won't get lost or go astray
As I'm fated for the material world
Get frustrated in the material world
Senses never gratified
Only swelling like a tide
That could drown me in the material world
From the spiritual sky
Such sweet memories have I
To the spiritual sky
How I pray
Yes I pray
That I won't get lost or go astray
While I'm living in the material world
Not much giving in the material world
Got a lot of work to do
Try to get a message through
And get back out of this material world
I'm living in the material world
Living in the material world
I hope to get out of this place
By the Lord Sri Krishna's grace
My salvation from the material worldNow the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord
And the law says if you don't give
Then you don't get loving
Now the Lord helps those that help themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you
We all make it out like we own this whole world
While the leaders of nations they're acting like big girls
With no thoughts for their god who provides us with all
But when death comes to claim them
Who will stand and who will fall?
Now the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord
And the law says if you don't give
Then you don't get loving
Yes the Lord helps those that help themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you
We all move around with objectives in mind
To become rich or famous with our reputations signed
But the few that can reach to this coveted slot
Don't escape old age creeping through their bodies like a rot
Now the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord
And the law says if you don't give
Then you don't get loving
Yes the Lord helps those that help themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on you
Now the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord
And the law says if you don't give
Then you don't get loving
And the Lord helps those that help themselves
And the law says whatever you do
Is going to come right back on youRemember now, be here now
As it's not like it was before
The past was, be here now
As it's not what it was before it was
Why try to live a life
That isn't real
No how
A mind that wants to wander
'Round a corner
Is an unwise mind
Now is, be here now
And it's not what it was before
Remember now, be here now
As it's not like it was before it wasWay back in time, someone said try some
I tried some, now buy some, I bought some, oh oh oh
After a while when I had tried them, denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you
Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
Till I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Through my life, I've seen gray sky met big fry
Seen them die to get high, oh oh oh
And when it seemed that I would always be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy someThe day the world gets 'round
To understanding where it is
Using all it's found
To help each other, hand in hand
The day the world gets 'round
To understanding where it's gone
Losing so much ground
Killing each other, hand in hand
Such foolishness in man
I want no part of their plan, no
You're the destructive kind
Now I'm working from day to day
As I don't want to be like you
A love with a pure heart
And the ones who have made a start
But Lord, there are just a few
Who bow before you in silence they pray
Oh how they pray for
The day the world gets 'round
Using all they've found
To help each other, hand in hand
The day the world gets 'roundThat is all I want to say
Our love could save the day
That is all I'm waiting for
To try to love you more
That is all I want to do
To get right next to you
That is all I'm living for
Your love and nothing more
And that is all
Times I find it hard to say
With useless words getting in my way
Silence often says much more
Than trying to say what's been said before
That is all I want from you
A smile when I feel blue
That is all I'm waiting for
Your love and nothing more
And that is all
Silence often says much more
Than trying to say what's been said before
But that is all I want to do
To give my love to you
That is all I'm living for
Please let me love you more
And that is allWhen sunshine is not enough to make me feel bright
It's got me suffering in the darkness
That's so easy come by on the roadside
Of one long lifetime
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
When you stand there, watch tired bodies
Full of sickness and pain
To show you just how helpless you really are
When you get down to the truth it hurts me
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
Got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
When I think of the life I'm living
Pray God help me, give me your light
So I can love you and understand this repetition
That keeps me here feeling deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
When sunshine is not enough to make me feel bright
It's got me suffering in the darkness
That's so easy come by on the roadside
Of one long lifetime
You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blue
It's got me deep blue
You know I'm deep blueI'm the only one down here
Who's got nothing to say
About the war
Or the rice
That keeps going astray on its way to Bombay
That smog that keeps polluting up our shores
Is boring me to tears
Why don't you call me, Miss O'Dell?
I'm the only one down here
Who's got nothing to fear
From the waves
Or the rice
That keeps rollin' on right up to my front porch
The record player's broken on the floor
And Ben, he can't restore it
Miss O'Dell
I can tell you
Nothing new
Has happened since I last saw you
I'm the only one down here
Who's got nothing to say
About the hip
Or the dope
Or the cat with most hope to fill the Fillmore
That pushing, shoving, ringing on my bell
Is not for me tonight
Why don't you call me, Miss O'Dell?
Why don't you call me, Miss O'Dell?My friend came to me
With sadness in his eyes
He told me that he wanted help
Before his country dies
Although I couldn't feel the pain
I knew I had to try
Now I'm asking all of you
To help us save some lives
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Where so many people are dying fast
And it sure looks like a mess
I've never seen such distress
Now won't you lend your hand and understand?
Relieve the people of Bangladesh
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Such a great disaster, I don't understand
But it sure looks like a mess
I've never known such distress
Now please don't turn away
I want to hear you say
Relieve the people of Bangladesh
Relieve Bangladesh
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Now it may seem so far from where we all are
It's something we can't reject
It's something I can't neglect
Now won't you give some bread? Get the starving fed?
We've got to relieve Bangladesh
Relieve the people of Bangladesh
We've got to relieve Bangladesh
Relieve the people of BangladeshThey say they like it but now in the market
It may not go well as it's too laid back
You need some oomph, papa, nothing like Frank Zappa
And not new wave, they don't play that crap
Try beating your head on a brick wall
Hard like a stone
Don't have time for the music
They want the blood from a clone
I hear a clock ticking, I feel the nitpicking
I almost quit kicking at the wall
There seems a confusion under the illusion
That they know just what will suit you all
Beating my head on a brick wall
Hard like the stone
Ain't got time for the music
They want the blood from a clone
There is no sense to it, pure pounds and pence to it
They're so intense too, makes me amazed
Don't want no music but they're making you sick with
Some awful noises that may get played
By beating their heads on a brick wall
Hard like a stone
Ain't no messing around with music
Give them the blood from a clone
Beating my head on a brick wall
Hard like a stone
Ain't got time for the music
They want the blood from a clone
Where will it all lead us?
I thought we had freed us
From the mundane, seems I'm wrong again
Could be they lack roots, they're still wearing Jack boots
And marching somewhere in the pouring rain
Beating my head on a brick wall
Hard like a stone
Don't have time for the music
They want the blood from a clone
Beating my head on a brick wall
Hard like a stone
Ain't no messing around with music
Give them the blood from a clone
Beating my head on a brick wall
Hard like a stone
Ain't no time for the music
They want the blood from a cloneYou dance at the discotheque
That's why you look such a wreck
Your face is pale, you look drawn
Your clothes are dirty and torn
You've got the look in your eyes
That says you're half alive and you're lost inside
Meanwhile you're back in your cage
Ego'd out on the stage where the unconsciousness rules
You've got yourself in a bind
You don't know how to unwind
Your senses unsatisfied
Take you along on a ride
You've got a way and a stance
That says you'll dance the pants off of everyone
Then you go back on the floor
You got to get through the door where the unconsciousness rules
You've lost a screw in your head
It shows the way you're led, blind leading the blind
Nothing can stand in your way
You're living day after day where the unconsciousness rules
Oh yeah, oh yeah, unconsciousness rules
Oh yeah, oh yeah, unconsciousness rules
Oh yeah, oh yeah, unconsciousness rulesYou are the One
You are my love
You send the rain and bring the sun
You stand alone and speak the truth
You are the breath of life itself
Oh yes, you are
You are the One
You're in my dream
I hold you there in high esteem
I need you more each step I take
You are the love in life itself
Oh yes, you are
You are the One
You are the one that I'd die for
And you're all that is real
You are the essence of that
Which we taste, touch and feel
You are the One
No matter what
You are the real love that I've got
You are my friend and when life's through
You are the light in death itself
Oh yes, you are
You are the One
They call you Christ, Vishnu, Buddha, Jehovah, our Lord
You are Govindam, Bismillah, Creator of all
You are the One
No matter what
You are the real love that I've got
You are my friend and when life's through
You are the light in death itself
Oh yes, you are
You are the One
You are my love
You send the rain and bring the sun
You stand alone and speak the truth
You are the breath of life itself, oh yes, you are
The breath of life itself, oh yes, you areI'm shouting all about love
While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago
I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love
Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all
We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago
All those years ago
All those years ago
Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else that we despised
They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all, though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago
All those years ago
All those years agoBaltimore oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be dragging her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho, down in Louisiana
Where a two timing Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O
I'd like to ruffle his plumage
That Baltimore oriole
Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgiving is easy
It's a woman like, now and then
Could happen to thing
Send her back home
Home ain't home without her warbling
How she can sing
Make a lonely man happy, Baltimore oriole
Come down from that bough
Send her back home and alone
Home ain't home without her warbling
How she can sing
Make a lonely man happy, Baltimore oriole
Come down from that bough
Fly to your daddy nowTeardrops, I've had my share of crying buckets full of
Teardrops, so hard to take I got a soaking with those
Teardrops and it feels like I have taken over from the rain
In the heart of the lonely man
In and out of love more often where most others can
He walks the streets like the losers in some lovers game
He talks so sweet but the news is always much the same
Teardrops, I've had my share of crying buckets full of
Teardrops, so hard to take I got a soaking with those
Teardrops and it feels like I have taken over from the rain
In the eyes of the lonely one
Everything is cold and hopeless that he looks upon
He needs a friend, a lover who can comfort him
His deeds offend he knows that he has brought on him
Teardrops, I've had my share of crying buckets full of
Teardrops, so hard to take I got a soaking with those
Teardrops and it feels like I have taken over from the rain
Teardrops
Teardrops, I've had my share of crying buckets full of
Teardrops, so hard to take I got a soaking with those
Teardrops and it feels like I have taken over from the rain
Teardrops, I've had my share of crying buckets full of
Teardrops, so hard to take I got a soaking with those
Teardrops and it feels like I have taken over from the rain
Teardrops
Teardrops
TeardropsHe's fighting the forces of the darkness limitation
Falsehood and mortality which bar him
The way back into the higher world
While his whole being is bewildered
He does not know, no law of action
Taking refuge inside himself and he's saying
I need someone to show me
Illumine my consciousness
Remove the dark from in me
And give me that which I have lost
As all had seemed lost a light from Heaven breaking
A flash inward illumination
Enriched his life more than any words can tell
He stood there, life renewed fresh as rain
Scales were falling from his eyes again
The bolts of his prison opening he's saying
I found someone who showed me
Illumined my consciousness
Removed the dark from in me
And given me that which I had lost
You people don't have time to listen to him
You're too busy fighting revolutions
That keep you back down in the lower world
Your mirrors of understanding they need cleansing
Polish away the dust of desire
Before pure light will reflect in them
You need someone to show you
Illumine your consciousness
Remove the dark from in you
And give you that which you have lost
Illumine my consciousness
Remove the dark from in me
And give me that which I have lost
I need someone to show me
Illumine my consciousness
Remove the dark from in me
And give me that which I have lost
You need someone to show you
Illumine your consciousness
Remove the dark from in you
And give you that which you have lost
Illumine your consciousnessThe writing's on the wall, brother
Your life is in your hands
It's up to you to see the writing's on the wall
It looks you in the eye, mister
It's time we stand up tall
Go see and understand the writing's on the wall
Strange we hold on to things that have no grace or power
While death holds on to us much more with every passing hour
And all the time you thought it would last
Your life, your friends would always be
Until they're drunk away or shot away or die away from you
There's nothing that you need, sister
The Lord is in you all
Life is designed to see the writing's on the wall
The music's in the air, mothers
You may have heard it call
To you that you may see the writing's on the wall
And all the time you thought it would last
Your life, your friends would always be
But they're drunk away and shot away and die away from you
Be careful going home, sister
Be watchful down that road
You've got a lot of love, sister
More to grow
The writing's on the wall, brothers
Your life is in your hands
It's up to you to see the writing's on the wall
I hope that you may see the writing on the wallIt's the story of a very unfortunate colored man
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old Buddha's gong
And now he's popping the piano just to raise the price
Of a ticket to the land of the free
Well, he says his home's in Frisco where they send the rice
But it's really in Tennessee
That's why he said
"I need someone to love me
I need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there
I need someone to lend me a fifty dollar bill and then
I'll leave Hong Kong behind me
For happiness once again
Won't somebody believe
I've a yen to see that Bay again
Every time I try to leave
Sweet opium won't let me fly away
I need someone to love me
I need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there"
That's the story of a very unfortunate colored man
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old Buddha's gongWe've got to save the world
Someone else may want to use it
So far we've seen
This planet's rape, how we've abused it
We've got to save the world
The Russians have the biggest share
With their long fingers everywhere
And now they've bombs in outer space
With laser beams and atomic waste
Rain forest chopped for paper towels
One acre gone in every hour
Our birds and wildlife all destroyed
To keep some millionaires employed
We've got to save the whale
Greenpeace they've tried to diffuse it
But dog food salesmen
Persist on kindly to harpoon it
We've got to save the world
The armament consortium
They're selling us plutonium
Now you can make your own H-bomb
Right in the kitchen with your mom
The nuclear power that costs you more
Than anything you've known before
The half-wit's answer to a need
For cancer, death, destruction, greed
We've got to save the world
Someone's children they may need it
So far we've seen
The big business of extinction bleed it
We've got to save the world
We're at the mercy of so few
With evil hearts determined to
Reduce this planet into hell
Then find a buyer and make quick sale
To end up on a happy note
Like trying to make concrete float
Is very simple knowing that
God in your heart lives
We've got to save the world
Someone else may want to use it
It's time you knew how close we've come
We're going to lose it
We gotta save, we gotta save, we gotta save the worldSitting as the noonday sun
Shines high up in a clear blue sky
While warming me I drift away
No memories of the times gone by
The moment that I lose my mind
You come into my heart and say
I'm always here for you to love
Surrender to me, let me stay
Sinking deeper still inside
I feel awakened from my dreams
Resting in some golden flow
Becoming part of you it seems
Nothing separates my life
From that which we have called our goal
It's all in this external world
Results from deep within my soul
As I open up my eyes
The sky has changed into a glow
My sense of time had disappeared
I see the sun has sunken low
I feel such joy and call your name
You're everything my eyes could see
I'll gladly kiss it all goodbye
Stay ever in your company
Sri krishna
Sat singing
Sat, satI know that I seem strange to you sometimes
Who is it in here, you have often thought
But what can I tell you
That you don't know already?
Yes, even the times like this will roll away
But I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
That's all that I have ever really wanted
I know that it will work out all the same
And whoever it is in here can overcome the pain
A true friend's shoulder to lean on
I'll make it through
And over and over I feel for you
But I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
That's all that I have ever really wanted
Oh yeah, you know that sometimes a man
He has nowhere to lay his head
But what can I tell you
That you don't know already?
Yes, even the worst times will blow away
But I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
That's all that I have ever really wanted
Oh yeah, you know that sometimes a man
He has nowhere to lay his head
Nowhere, I said nowhere
Nowhere to lay his head
Oh what can I tell you
That you don't know already?All through my life I've been hearing
All about those good old days
It makes no difference
What was or what may be
The past it is gone
The future may not be at all
The present improve the flying hour
Some people look into the future
They're hoping that they'll see better days
It's such a sweet thought
It's something that could be but
The past it is gone
The future may not be at all
The present improve the flying hour
What was and what may be
Is not here, it is not clear to me
Right now is the one thing
That I can feel, the one thing real to me
Uh-uh - uh-uh
So as you sit back to remember
That which you cannot recall
It makes no difference
What was or what may be
The past it is gone
The future may not be at all
The present improve the flying hour
It makes no difference
What was or what may be
The past it is gone
The future may not be at all
The present improve the flying hour
The past it is gone
The future may not be at all
The present improve the flying hourHave my love, it fits you like a glove
Join my dream, tell me yes
Bail out, should there be a mess
The pieces you don't need are mine
Take my time, I'll show you cloud 9
Take my smile and my heart
They were yours from the start
The pieces to omit are mine
Have my love, use it while it does you good
Share my highs but the times
That it hurts pay no mind
Those pieces you don't need are mine
I'll see you there on cloud 9
Take my hope, maybe even share a joke
If there's good to be shown
You may make it all your own
And if you want to quit that's fine
While you're out looking for cloud 9And now it begins to shine
And you found the eyes to see
Each little drop at dawn of every day
Your smile, it comes back to me
And whatever you may say
Don't let it stop, never fade away
As we got to get out in this world together
Then we might as well start to make some changes
If that's what it takes
(That's what it takes)
Then I've got to be strong
(That's what it takes)
Don't want to be wrong
If that's what it takes
The closer I get
(That's what it takes)
Into that open door
(What it takes)
I've got to be sure
If that's what it takes
And now that it's shining through
And you can see all this world
Don't let it stop, never fade away
If we got to be in this life forever
Then we'd better be taking all the chances
If that's what it takes
(That's what it takes)
Then I've got to be strong
(That's what it takes)
Don't want to be wrong
If that's what it takes
The closer I get
(That's what it takes)
Into that open door
(What it takes)
I've got to be sure
If that's what it takes
That's what it takes, that's what it takes
That's what it takes, that's what it takes
What it takes, that's what it takes
That's what it takes, what it takes
That's what it takes
That's what it takes
That's what it takesI know you're in the sun
I know you're close to everyone
At times it's like you don't have a hold on me
I see you in the love
I see you in the moon above
But I want to know that you're not lost inside of me
You know I need you
You know I love you
If I'm not with you
I'm not so much of a man
I'm like a fish on the sand
You call me in the night (you call me in the night)
And hide behind the daylight
You're blowing like a wind, you don't let me see
You know I feel a pain (you know I feel a pain)
I'm tired of playing games with you
Though there's nothing else I want that would set me free
You know I love you
You know I need you
If I can't be with you
I'm not so much of a man
I'm a fish on the sand
No use to no one else, they've all dried up
Watching all our lives go by
I can't believe you'd want to see me crying
I hold you in my heart (hold you in my heart)
I know that you're a part of me
But it's a must to know that you love me too
I look you in the eye (look you in the eye)
You're swimming by my teardrops
But I want to know for sure that you'll let me see
You know I want you
You know I need you
If I'm not with you
I'm not so much of a man
I'm like a fish on the sand
You know I need you
You know I love you
If I'm not with you
I'm not so much of a man
I'm a fish on the sand
Not so much of a man
More a fish on the sandJust for today
I could try to live through this day only
Not deal with all life's problems
Just for today
If just for one night
I could feel not sad and lonely
Not be my own life's problem
Just for one night
If just today
I could try to live through this day only
Not deal with all life's problems
Just for today
If just for one night
I could feel not sad and lonely
Not be my own life's problem
Just for one night
Just for today
I could try to live through this day only
Not deal with all life's problems
Just for today
Just for todayVicious words drift away from their meaning
And the sun melts the chill from our lives
Helping us all to remember what we came here for
This is love, this is la la la la love
This is love, this is la la la la love
Little things that will change you forever
May appear from way out of the blue
Making fools of everybody who don't understand
This is love, this is la la la la love
This is love, this is la la la la love
This is love
This is love
This is love, this is la la la la love
Since our problems have been our own creation
They also can be overcome
When we use the power provided free to everyone
This is love, this is la la la la love
This is love, this is la la la la loveBack then long time ago when grass was green
Woke up in a daze
Arrived like strangers in the night
Fab - Long time ago when we was fab
Fab - Back when income tax was all we had
Caresses fleeced you in the morning light
Casualties at dawn
And we did it all
Fab - Long time ago when we was fab
Fab - You are my world you are my only love
And while you're in this world
The fuzz gonna come and claim you
But you mo' better wise
When the buzz gonna come and take you away
Take you away, take you away
The microscopes that magnified the tears
Studied warts and all
Still the life flowed on and on
Fab - Long time ago when we was fab
Fab - But it's all over now baby blue
Fab - Long time ago when we was fab
Fab - like this pullover you sent to me
Fab - And you've really got a hold me
Fab - Long time ago when we was fabGossip, gossip, gossip, gossip
I heard it in the night, words that thoughtless speak
Like vultures swooping down below on the devil's radio
I hear it through the day, airwaves getting filled
With gossip broadcast to and fro on the devil's radio
Oh yeah, gossip, gossip, oh yeah
He's in the clubs and bars and never turns it down
Talking about what he don't know on the devil's radio
He's in your TV set, won't give it a rest
That soul betraying so and so, the devil's radio
Gossip, gossip, gossip, gossip
Oh yeah, gossip, gossip, oh yeah
Gossip, oh yeah, oh yeah, gossip
It's white and black like industrial waste
Pollution of the highest degree
You wonder why I don't hang out much
I wonder how you can't see
He's in the films and songs and on all your magazines
It's everywhere that you may go, the devil's radio
Oh yeah, gossip, gossip, oh yeah
Runs thick and fast, no one really sees
Quite what bad it can do
As it shapes you into something cold
Like an Eskimo igloo
It's all across our lives like a weed it's spread
Until nothing else has space to grow, the devil's radio
Can creep up in the dark, make us hide behind shades
And buzzing like a dynamo, the devil's radio
Gossip, oh yeah, gossip, oh yeah, gossip
Gossip, gossip, gossip, oh yeah, gossip
I heard you on Satan's wireless, gossip, oh yeah
You know the devil's radio, child, gossip
Gossip, gossip, gossip(Someplace else)
You got into my life
I don't know how you found me but you did
It stopped me heading someplace else
Took me a while to say, wish you belong to me
But now I'm saddened like I've never been
Regretting that we'll leave
And for a while, you could comfort me
And hold me for some time
I need you now, to be beside me
While all my world is so untidy
Loneliness
Empty faces
Wish I could leave them all
In someplace else
(Someplace else)
I hope you won't let go, maybe you'll let me know
That you'll be saddened like you've never been
Regretting that we'll leave
And for a while, I could comfort you
And hold you in my mind
I need you now to be beside me
While all my world is sad and crazy
Loneliness
Empty faces
Wish I could leave them all
In someplace else
And for a while, you could comfort me
And hold me for some time
I need you now, to be beside me
While all my world is so untidy
Loneliness
Empty faces
Wish I could leave them all
In someplace else
Loneliness
Empty faces
Wish I could leave them all
In someplace else
(Someplace else)
I think I'm going to leave them all
In someplace else
(Someplace else)I'm not the wreck of the Hesperus
Feel more like the Wall of China
Getting old as Methuselah
Feel tall as the Eiffel Tower
I'm not a power of attorney
But I can rock as good as Gibraltar
Ain't no more no spring chicken
Been plucked but I'm still kicking
But it's alright, it's alright
Poison penmen sneak, have no nerve to speak
Make up lies then they leak them out
Behind a pseudonym, the rottenness in them
Reaching out trying to touch me
Met some Oscars and Tonys
I slipped on a pavement oyster
Met a snake climbing ladders
Got out of the line of fire
(But it's alright)
Brainless writers gossip nonsenses
To others heads as dense as they is
It's the same old malady
What they see is faulty
I'm not the wreck of the Hesperus
Feel more like Big Bill Broonzy
Getting old as my mother
But I tell you I got some company
(But it's alright)
But it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, alright, it's alrightIn another life
I woke up dreaming with a sigh
As the morning light
Was painting whispers of a joy
And I was in the candlelit bedroom
Enchanting beauty shimmering magically
Like an iridescent cloud
Being blown by a westerly wind, ooh
She can move your soul without you knowing
She can take the breath away from heaven, ooh
And I was captured by her loneliness
A wounded tiger on a willowy path
Like an opalescent moon all alone
In the sky of the foreign land
She can take the breath away from heaven
She can move your soul without you knowing
She can take the breath away from heaven
She is like an everlasting blossom
She can take the breath away from heavenI got my mind set on you

I should be sailing away on a liner
I was knocked on my back on a dock at Yang-Tse
It's a hell of a way to see China
But I'm ready
You must be crazy
And you got no money
And you're a liar
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire
I'd like to trust you but I've broken my rickshaw
Sometimes there's no hope in, in chasing opium
I'd like to love you but I'm not sure what's in your eyes
Mmm, Shanghai Surprise
Whatever you're saying, I want it anyway in
Been hanging 'round like a kid at your back door (Ooh, babe)
You could be kinder, and show me Asia minor
I'll let you love me, let you see what's here in my eyes
Shanghai Surprise
You must be crazy (Crazy)
And you got no money (Money)
And it seems like madness
Back streets so crowded that, no room to swing a cat
I'd like to know you but you're acting so coolie
I'm finding out pursued by, evil looking dudes it's
Getting hot for me like tofu when it deep fries
Oh, Shanghai Surprise
But, baby, you look like any common crook
That's hanging 'round in those real shady places (Ooh, babe)
While you assess me, why not try to impress me?
Step over here, let me see what's there in your eyes
Oh, Shanghai Surprise
I don't understand how I got delayed
I should be sailing today on a liner
Was kicked in the ass on a dock at Yang-Tse
It's no way for a man to see China
But I'm ready
You must be crazy (Crazy)
And you got no money (Money)
But you're a trier
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire
I'd like to meet you but I've broken my chopstick
Sometimes there's no hope in, in chasing promises
I wanna love you though it could prove to be unwise
Shanghai Surprise
Whatever you're saying, I want it anyway in
Been hanging 'round for a ride on your rickshaw (Ooh, babe)
You may correct me, now that you've inspected me
Come over here, let me feel you cut down to size
Oh, Shanghai Surprise
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire
I'd like to know you but I'm not really social
Sometimes it's no joke, can't cope with opium
I'd like to love you but I'm not sure what's in your eyes

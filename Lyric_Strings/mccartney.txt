Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?To lead a better life I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhereGood day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshineYour day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted yearsI was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah!
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
I told that girl I can start right away
When she said listen, babe, I got something to say
I got no car and it's breakin' my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
Ooooh oh la la-la
Ooooh oh la la-laSay the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine

Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Say the word, love

My MichelleI'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed

Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight

All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away

Well, she was just 17, if you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"

Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
She’ll remember and she’ll miss her only one, lonely one

'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery (Oh oh oh)

From the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

Was in vain

Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats
Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
We're going home
Better believe it
GoodbyeWhen I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "let it be"
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it beOh, dirty Maggie Mae, they have taken her away

(Oh my soul, so hard.)My baby said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "you've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
Oh, Danny boy, the old savanna callingThe long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahRosetta...

Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
{Instrumental bridge}
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Round and round and round and round and round
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Oh (Round and round and round)

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny LaneHow does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you traveled very far?
Far as the eye can see
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do

Baby, you're a rich man, too
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby, you're a rich man

And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?

For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day, you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend

Darling, I love youLook what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl

When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club BandIt's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)
I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
Getting so much better all the time!I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will goWednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
For so many years
She's leaving home (Bye-bye)When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoo!Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)
Rita!
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Lovely Rita meter maid (Lovely meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Oh Lovely Rita, meter meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club BandI read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today—oh, boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
Joan was quizzical;
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
(Do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
(Do-do-do-do)
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one,"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, 
Screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oa
(Do-do-do-do-do)
(Silver hammer man)Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you (Wooo!)
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me, you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me, that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
(Believe me, darling!)
When you told me (Woo!) you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me, darling)
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harmBecause the world is round, it turns me on
Because the world is round
Because the wind is high, it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blueYou never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

Oh look out! It's-"
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeahOnce there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry

Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

And in the middle of the celebrations

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
C'mon, Rocky boy
C'mon, Rocky boyWhy don't we d-do it in the road?

You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

This is the story of a boy named Ted
If his mother said, "Ted, be good", he would
She told him tales about his soldier dad
But it made her sad, then she'd cry, oh my
Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good
And he knew he could, 'cause in his head he said
"Mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mama don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"
Then came the day she found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran, far away, okay
He couldn't stand to see his mother in love with another man
He didn't know, oh no
He found a place where he could settle down
And from time to time, in his head he said
"Mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"
And she said, "Teddy don't worry, now mommy is here
Taking good care of you
Teddy don't worry, your mommy is here
Mommy's going to see you through"

You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you
Baby, I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man

There is a fine line between recklessness and courage
It's about time you understood which road to take
It's a fine line, and your decision makes a difference
Get it wrong, you'll be making a big mistake
Come home brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come home brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay
Whatever's more important to you
You've got to choose what you wanna do
Whatever's more important to be
That's the view that you've gotta see
There is a long way between chaos and creation
If you don't say which one of these your gonna choose
It's a long way, and in every contradiction
Seems to say it's a game that you're bound to lose
Come home brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come home brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay
Come on back, come on back
Come on back to me
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
Whatever's more important to you (It's a fine line)
You got to choose what you want to do
Whatever's more important to be (It's a fine line)
That's the thing that you've gotta see
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine lineHow kind of you to think of me
When I was out of sorts
It really meant a lot to be
In someone else's thoughts
Someone else's mind
Someone else as kind as you
The thoughtfulness you showed has made
A difference in my life
I won't forget how unafraid
You were that long dark night
I thought that all was lost
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind as you
I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me
How kind of you to stick by me
During the final bout
And listen to the referee
As I was counted out
I thought my time was up
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind as you
I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me
How kind of you to think of me
How kind of youLike so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart took her song away
Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world and its foolish ways
How we spend our days casting love aside
Losing sight of life day by day
She saw poverty breaking up her home
Wounded warriors took her song away
But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world mends its foolish ways
Then we'll spend our days catching up on life
All because of you, Jenny Wren
You saw who we are, Jenny WrenAt the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
Who can handle such a heavy load?
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
We can think of nothing more to say
If you show me love, I won't refuse
I know you'd never make me choose
Between the love I've got and the love I'd lose
Sometimes I'd rather run and hide
Than stay and face the fear inside
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
Who can bear to turn their head away?
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
We can watch the universe explode
If you take me up, I won't say no
I guess you'd rather see me grow
Into a better man than the one you know
Sometimes my head is hanging low
It's time to get on with the show
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
I can think of nothing more to sayI've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to leave
So I don't have to hide
I prefer they didn't know
So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go
I've been sliding down a slippery slope
I've been climbing up a slowly burning rope
But the flame is getting low
I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go
You never need to worry about me, I'll be fine on my own
Someone else can worry about me
I've spent a lot of time on my own
I've spent a lot of time on my own
I've been waiting till the danger passed
I don't know how long the storm is going to to last
If we're going to carry on
I'll been waiting on the other side, till your friends are gone
So tell me what I want to know
I'll be waiting on the other side, for your friends to go
Someone else can worry about me
I've spent a lot of time on my own
I've spent a lot of time on my own
I've been waiting on the other side
For your friends to leave so I don't have to hide
I prefer they didn't know
So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go
I've been waiting on the side
I've been waiting on the other side
For your friends to goWould you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea?
Very twee, very me
Any sunny morning
What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning
Miles of miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively
Do you know the game croquet?
Peradventure we might play
Very gay, hip hooray
Any sunny morning
Miles of miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively
As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost supper time
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
On a Sunday morningLaugh, when your eyes are burning
Smile, when your heart is filled with pain
Sigh, as you brush away your sorrow
Make a vow, that's it's not going to happen again
It's not right, in one life
Too much rain
You know the wheels keep turning
Why do the tears run down your face?
We use to hide away our feelings
But for now, tell yourself it won't happen again
It's not right, in one life
Too much rain
It's too much for anyone, too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laugh
Smile, when you're spinning round and round
Sigh, as you think about tomorrow
Make a vow, that you're gonna be happy again
It's all right, in your life
No more rain
It's too much for anyone, too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laughA certain softness in her eyes facinates me
More than I ever thought it would (a certain softnesss)
More than I ever thought it could
A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
A kind of sadness in her smile captivates me
Surer than anything that's sure (a kind of sadness)
Surer than anything before
A kind of sadness in her smile
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
If I could even find the words to tell her
I wouldn't want to anyway
Cause that would only break the spell
And you know very well I couldn't betray her
A touch of wildness in her style haunts my memory
More than I ever thought it would (a touch of wildness)
More than I ever thought it could
A touch of wildness her style
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
A certain softness in her eyes facinates me
More than I ever thought it would (a certain softnesss)
More than I ever thought it could
A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hookedI bit my tongue
I never talked too much
I tried to be so strong
I did my best
I used the gentle touch
I've done it for so long
You put me down
But I can laugh it off
And act like nothing's wrong
But why pretend
I think I've heard enough
Of your familiar song
I tell you what I'm going to do
I'll try to take my mind off you
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself
You're not aware
Of what you put me through
But now the feeling's gone
But I don't mind
Do what you have to do
You don't fool anyone
I tell you what I'm going to do
I'll take a different point of view
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself
The definition of friendship
Apparently ought to be
Showing support for the one that you love
And I was open to friendship
But you didn't seem to have any to spare
While you were riding to Vanity Fair
There was a time
When every day was young
The sun would always shine
We sang along
When all the songs were sung
Believing every line
That's the trouble with friendship
For someone to feel it
It has to be real or it wouldn't be right
And I keep hoping for friendship
But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there
While you were riding to Vanity FairYou lift up my spirits, you shine on my soul
Whenever I'm empty, you make me feel whole
I can rely on you, to guide me through, any situation
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me
You give me directions, you show me the way
You give me a reason, to face every day
I can depend on you, to send me to, any destination
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me, follow me
Down the track of loneliness, down the path of love
Through the words of heartache, to the end
On the shores of sorrow, where the waves of hope crash in
The perfect place for me to find a friend
You lead me to places, that I've never been
Uncovering secrets, that I've never seen
I can rely on you, to guide me through, any situation
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow meLooking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away
Like the sun that rises every day
We can chase the dark clouds from the sky
I gave my promise to you girl, I don't wanna take it back
You and me, side by side, we know how to change the world
That is why, I gave my promise to you girl
Hey, why wait another day, that won't get us anywhere
All the time, that it takes, to repair this brave old world
Will be ours, I gave my promise to you girl
Every single second of our lives
We can use to chase the clouds away
Well, there's no more barking up the tree, no more howling at the moon
They won't see, you and I, diving for the deepest buck
That is why, I gave my promise to you girl
Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves awayI'm very sure
This never happened to me before
I met you, and now I'm sure
This never happened before
Now I see
This is the way it's supposed to be
I met you, and now I see
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own
So come to me
Now we can be what we want to be
I love you, and now I see
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own
I'm very sure
This never happened to me before
I met you, and now I'm sure
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)If you love me, won't you call me?
I've been waiting, waiting too long
In my soul is constant yearning
Always singing, singing this song
Only love is strong enough to take it on the chin
When did I begin to fall?
Anyway, anyway
You can make that call
You feel free to make yourself
At home
If we could be closer longer
That would help me, help me so much
We can cure each other's sorrow
Won't you please, please, please get in touch
If our love is strong enough, it may never end
Why would I pretend to fall?
Anyway, anyway
You can make that call
You feel free to make yourself
At home
Anyway, anyway
Anyway at all
Anyway you can make that callThere once was a time when I thought if I had a house, I'd be happy
There once was a time when I thought if I had a car, I'd be made
One by one I achieved my ambitions
But didn't feel like I wanted to feel
Didn't feel like I wanted it to feel
I didn't feel like I wanted to feel
I needed a comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I needed a comfort of love
Just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh
I long for the time when the world is a better place, to be happy
I long for the day when the people who went to sleep, will awake
One by one I improved my conditions
But it doesn't feel like I wanted to feel
Doesn't feel like I wanted it to feel
Doesn't feel like I wanted to feel
I needed the comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I need the comfort of love
To just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh
I needed a comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I needed a comfort of love
To just to get me some piece of mind
Well, I needed the comfort
I needed the comfort
I needed the comfort of love
I needed the comfort
I needed the comforteWe were growing, time was going so fast
Without knowing, we were growing so fast
We were lying down, in the shade
I remember the love we made
We were lying down, on a bed
I remember the tears we shed
We were growing, time was going so fast, (Growing up)
Without knowing, (Falling down) we were growing up fast (Growing up, Falling down)
(Growing up, Falling down)
We were laughing too, we were sad
I remember the fun we had
We were crying loud, with the pain
We will never be here again
Growing up, falling downIn the summer of '59, dandelions shine up through the pavement
Pedal pushers in the bushes
Waspy binges, sixteen inches round her waist
And it’s all in the name of good taste
In the summer of '59, dandelions shine up through the pavement
Fluorescent socks and fishnet stockings
Dirty combs from ideal homes, and girls are chaste
And it's all in the name of good taste
Good taste, nobody knew what we knew then
Good taste, look at the boys turn into men
Good taste, nobody knew what we knew then
Look at the girls turn into women
Uh, ooh, uh, ooh, uh
Look at the girls turn into women
Uh, ooh, uh, ooh, uh
Some of the girls turned into women
Ooh
In the summer of ’59, dandelions shine up through the pavement
Council houses, drainpipe trousers
Ciggy packs and long black jackets, ties are laced
And it's all in the name of good taste
Good taste, nobody knew what we knew then
Good taste, look at the boys turn into men
Good taste, nobody knew what we knew then
Look at the girls turn into women
Uh, ooh, uh, ooh, uh
Look at the girls turn into women
Uh, ooh, uh, ooh, uh
Some of the girls turned into women
Ooh
In the summer of '59Somebody told me to walk away
When love got hard and I had to pay
But you know it’s such a shame
Nobody knows how to play this loving game
Sometimes we all seem to act like fools
But do we care who breaks the rules?
I suppose it’s all the same
We never learn how to play this loving game
Do I love you after so much
As I did before?
Darling, I could hardly love you more
I tried to look for some good advice
'Cause we all have to pay the price
But 'til now, it never came
I’ll never know how to play this loving game
Do I love you half as much
As I used to do?
No one knows me half as well as you
Yeah, you know you do, you know you
Somebody told me to walk away
When love got hard and I had to play
But you know that it’s still a shame
Nobody knows how to play this loving game
Nobody knows how to play this loving game
Nobody knows how to play this loving gameI want you to fly
I want you to grow
I like you to get back
Whatever you lose
I want you to learn
What you wanna know
I like you to follow
The road that you choose
Ooh, at the same time
I wanna hold on
Don't want you to go
I like to be near you
Whatever you do
I want us to hide (ooh)
I want to lay low (ooh)
Doesn't make sense but (ooh)

So the cages open now
We take him fly to
Rising and falling like snow
In the nights
I'm feeling while a windy scene
Between my palms
I've got my hands and the bird
Flies out

Rising and falling like snow
In the nightsThough is so beautiful, but she is so fine
Yes she is so beautiful and she says, she's mine
For her face that shines, in the morning glow
And the outside world, will never know
What she means to me, and what I owe to her
But she is so beautiful, she is so devine
Yes she is so beautiful, and she's mine, she's mine
She can make me smile, as we start the day
And to hear her laugh, takes my breath away
Will I ever find, any words to say to her
Though is so beautiful, but she is so fine
Yes she is so beautiful, and she's mine, she says, she's mineI can try to give you everything you ever wanted
You're not hard to please
And the only thing I'm asking in return is something
You can give with ease
Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us
Save us now
I've got a feeling there's a jungle rhythm beating in me
When I'm close to you
I don't really want to ask for many favors
But there's something you can do
Keep on sending your love
In the heat of battle
We've got something that'll save us
Save us now
Woah, oh, oh, oh
You're my woman
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Keep it coming
Woah, oh, oh, oh
You've got something that can save us, save us
Keep on sending your love
Cause in the heat of battle
You've got something that'll save us
Save us now
Save us now
Save us nowI want someone to come home to
I need somewhere I can sleep
I need a place where I can rest my weary bones
And have a conversation not too deep
Everybody else busy doing better than me
But I can see why it is, they've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains, someone letting them be
I want someone who can save me
When I come home from the zoo
I need somebody who's a sweet communicator
I can give my alligator to
Everybody seem to know what they are talking about
And I can see why it is, they got someone breaking them out
Someone finding a key, someone setting them free
Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Could you dare to find my key?
I want someone who can bail me
When I get up to my tricks
I need somebody used to dealing with a sinner
Whenever I get in a fix
Everybody else busy doing better than me
But I can see why it is, they've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains, someone letting them be
Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Could you dare to find my key?On my way to work, I rode a big green bus
I could see everything from the upper deck
People came and went, smoking cigarettes
I picked the packets up, when the people left
But all the time I thought of you
How far away the future seemed
How could I have so many dreams
And one of them not come true?
On my way to work, I bought a magazine
Inside a pretty girl liked to water-ski
She came from Chichester to study history
She had removed her clothes for the likes of me
But all the time I thought of you
How would you know that I was there?
How could I soul-search everywhere
Without knowing what to do?
On my way to work, as I was clocking in
I could see everything, how it came to be
People come and go, smoking cigarettes
I pick the packets up, when the people leave
But all the time I think of you
How far away the future seems
How could I have so many dreams
And one of them not come true?
On my way to work
But all the time I thought of you
How would you know that I was there?
How could I soul-search everywhere
Without knowing what to do?
On my way to work
On my way to workThere were rules you never told me, never came up with a plan
All the stories that you sold me didn't help me understand
But I had to get it worked out, had nobody who could help
So then in the end it turned out that I had to do it by myself
Life's a game, rags from riches
Dogs and bitches hunt for fame
Difficult to know which way to turn
Lay the blame on the snitches
Wicked witches fan the flame
Careful what you touch in case you burn
Queenie eye, Queenie eye, who's got the ball?

I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazed
Dressed in black from head to toe
Two guitars across our backs, we would walk the city roads
Seeking someone who would listen to the music
That we were writing down at home
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazy
Hair slicked back with Vaseline
Like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop
Hearing noises we were destined to remember
We willed the thrill to never stop
May sweet memories of friends from the past
Always come to you, when you look for them
And your inspiration, long may it last
May it come to you, time and time again
Now everybody seems to have their own opinion
Who did this and who did that
But as for me I don't see how they can remember
When they weren't where it was at
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazed
I lived through those early days
I lived through those early daysDon't look at me
It's way too soon to see
What's gonna be
Don't look at me
All my life
I never knew
What I could be, what I could do
Then we were new
You came along
And made my life a song
One lucky day
You came along
Just in time
Well I was searching for a rhyme
You came along
Then we were new
We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see there's no guarantee
We got nothing to lose
Don't look at me
I can't deny the truth
It's plain to see
Don't look at me
All my life
I never knew
What I could be, what I could do
Then we were new
We can do what we want
We can live as we choose
You see there's no guarantee

She tries to explain, then it happens again
Everybody's looking at her
She's got everybody talking about her
She's good, she's kind, she's so refined
But me, I'm losing my mind
Though she haunts me like the sound of the rain
Or a river running down to the ocean
I hate to complain but it's happening again
Everybody's looking at her
She's got everybody talking about her
She's good, so fine, she's sweet as wine
But me, I'm losing my mind
Doesn't she know, why can't she see
Look at the effect, she's having on me
I'm not alone, I'm part of the crowd
Turning our heads, as she walks down the street
She tries to explain, then it happens again

I'm losing my mindWe came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm
The road to somewhere
Stretches through the night
We follow blindly
Heading for the light
I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right
We held each other
Praying for a spark
Two crazy partners
Scrambling in the dark
Now where are we going
Searching in the night
We had a feeling
It's going to be alright
I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right
Two crazy partners
Searching in the night
We've got a feeling
It's going to be alright
We follow blindly
Heading for the light
We've got a feeling
It's going to be, it's going to be alright
We came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm
The road to somewhere
Stretches through the night
We follow blindly
Heading for the light
Heading for the light{Intro}
I'm scared to say I love you
Afraid to let you know
That the simplest of words won't come out of my mouth
Though I'm dying to let them go
Trying to let you know
I have to say I'm sorry
Don't feel sad for me
But the beautiful birds won't fly out of their cage
Though I'm trying to set them free
Trying to let you see, how much you mean to me
I remember the first time we met
Tears in our eyes reflecting
Something connecting from so long ago
It might have been told in the stars maybe that's what it was
It doesn't matter because
I'm still too scared to tell you
Afraid to let you see
That the simplest of words won't come out of my mouth
Though I'm dying to set them free
Trying to let you see, how much it means to me
How much you mean to me
How much you mean to me nowI took a trip into the ocean
High emotion filled me with desire
I had to see what I was fighting
That kept inviting me to take it higher
Well looking back it didn't hurt me
It did something for my soul
It taught me when you find a love
Don't break it, try to make it whole
I took a walk into the fire
When I heard you calling me
I took a chance and what a good thing
It turned out to be
It turned out
It turned out
It turned out to be
Well now it's done and out of nowhere
I can go wherever pleases me
If you don't mind some stormy weather
We'll be together in our fantasy
Looking back it didn't hurt me
It did something for my soul
It taught me when you find a love
Don't break it, try to make it whole
I took a walk into the fire
When I heard you calling me
I took a chance and what a good thing
It turned out to be
It turned out
It turned out
It turned out to be
It turned out
It turned out
It turned out to beI get a feeling when they call my name
Feels like we're all involved in some kind of game
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, get me out of here
Hear the taxman knocking at my door
I've got a feeling he'll be asking for more
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
Yeah
When we fight I don't know what to say
If feels so bad and yet I can't run away
Oh boy, oh boy someone get me out of here
I'm a celebrity
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
I see the doctor coming down the street
I got no fever, but I'm feeling the heat
Oh boy, (oh boy)
Get me out of here (someone get me out of here)
Oh boy, (oh boy) someone get me out of here
Oh boy, (oh boy)
Get me out of here (someone get me out of here)
Oh boy, (oh boy) someone get me out of hereI can't ask you to thrill me
That'd be asking too much
I can't ask you to fulfill my expectations that you gave me
After we first touched
But but the feeling that been building inside me
Is too hard to resist
I can't wait much longer till you tell me baby
There's some chance we'll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I'll be in with half a chance
I can't wait till I hear you tell me that you want me
Till then my dreams are gonna haunt me
Got my demons doing such a happy dance
Hey! Ah! Yeah!
Exorcise my demons, cast them out today
Only you can do it, make them go away
Let me know you love me, tell me there's a chance
I don't want to sit and watch my demons dance
Watch my demons dance
Watch my demons dance

Do you have to put me through these complications
When you know I try hard not to be wrong
But but the feeling that been building inside me
Is too hard to resist

There's a chance we'll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I'll be in with half a chance

I'm gonna look around and see
See what's right, see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after
One of these days, when a job just takes too long
I'm gonna sing my song and see
See what's right, see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after
It's there, it's round
It's to be found
By you, by me
It's all we ever wanted to be
One of these days, when we both are at our ease
When you've got time to please yourself
See what's right and see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after
It's there, it's round
It's to be found
By you, by me
It's all we ever wanted to see

For you to sink so low
You must have had a ton of pressure
Only answer if the answer's no
I need loving, you need loving too
Doesn't take a lot to get off the ground
There must have been a lot of magic
When the world was born
Let me be the one you wish for
One you call for, when you're all alone
I need loving, you need loving too
Wouldn't take a lot to get off the ground
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la
Fly around la la la la la la la, fly around la la la la la la la
Hear the sound, hear the sound
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la
Though it takes a lot of power
To make a big tree grow
It doesn't need a pot of knowledge
For a seed knows what a seed must know
You need loving, I need loving too
Doesn't take a lot to get off the ground
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la
Fly around la la la la la la la, fly around la la la la la la la
Hear the sound, hear the sound
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la
Hear the sound, hear the sound
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la
Yeah Yeah, off the groundI saw a cat with a machine in his brain
The man who fed him said he didn't feel any pain
I'd like to see that man take out that machine
And stick it in his own brain
You know what I mean
I saw a rabbit with its eyes full of tears
The lab that owned her had been doing it for years
Why don't we make them pay for every last eye
That couldn't cry its own tears?
Do you know what I mean?
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow
When we're looking for changes
I saw a monkey that was learning to choke
A guy beside him gave him cigarettes to smoke
And every time that monkey started to cough
The bastard laughed his head off
Do you know what I mean?
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow
When we're looking for changes
We're looking for changes
We're looking for changes
We're looking for changes in the way we areI will always be hoping, hoping
You will always he holding, holding
My heart in your hand. I will understand
I will understand someday, one day
You will understand always
Always from now until then
When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
And I wouldn't mind knowing, knowing
That you wouldn't mind going, going along with my plan
When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, I will understand
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, I will understand
Hope of deliveranceShe said, "come in my dear
You're looking tired tonight
Your bath is drawn, let me loosen your tie
And fix you your usual drink"
He settles back, takes a magazine
Kicks off his shoes, as he studies the form
Of every appealing soubrette
But where are the flowers that he used to bring?
Every endearing remark
Reminds her of passionate promises
That he only made in the dark
In her bed, she wants to shout at the back of his head
Look at me, look at me, look at me--I'm afraid
See what it's come to
I'm just your mistress and maid
The wine is warm, but the dinner is cold
The look in his eye tells her it won't be long
'Till the girls on the page come to life
They'll get the flowers that he used to bring
With every endearing remark
And all of the passionate promises
He'll never fulfill in the dark
In their bed, she wants to shout at the back of his head
Look at me, look at me, now that I'm not afraid
See what it's come to
I'm not your mistress and maid
See what it's come to
I'm not your mistress and maidLast night, you helped me through
Took me to the lovers zone
I saw there images
Projected on a wall of stone
I stood inside Egyptian temples
I looked into eternal gardens
Lay on the shores of distant islands
Listening to the sea bird's song of joy
Oh, I owe it all to you
You make me happy
Oh, I owe it all to you
Late last night, we were right
Into some exotic scene
Everywhere, images
Appearing on a giant screen
I stood inside a glass cathedral
I looked into the golden canyon
Lay by the lakes of holy water
Glistening like a diamond in the light
Oh, I owe it all to you
You make me happy
Oh, I owe it all to you
Oh, I owe it all to you
You make me happy
Oh, I owe it all to you
Egyptian temples, eternal gardens
Distant islands listening to the sea birds song of joy
Oh, I owe it all to you
You make me happy
Oh, I owe it all to youThere was a girl who loved a biker
She used to follow him across america
But the biker didn't like her
She didn't care, she still persisted
Though her brother said she was twisted
And the family said they wouldn't miss her
Anyway
She loved the biker like an icon
Gazing at his picture everyday
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away
She did her best to fix a meeting
She pulled it off one night in hollywood
When he met her he couldn't let her get away
He didn't ask for her permission
He took advantage of her position
But he was always her ambition
Anyway
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away
The family tried so hard to find her
They showed her picture across america
But no trace of her sweet face
Was ever found
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away
She loved the biker like an iconBest thing I ever saw
Was a man who loved his wife
In a place where things were good
I felt peace in the neighbourhood
That feeling in the air
Something was definitely there
It was a time when things were good
I felt peace in the neighbourhood
I was there, I really was
At the centre of a love vibration
People sharing with their friends
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Then i woke up from my dream
To see things as they really are
People struggling to survive
How can peace hope to stay alive?
Well i was there... I felt so good
At the centre of a love vibration
People caring for their world
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Best thing I ever saw
I saw a man who loved his wife
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhoodGolden earth girl, female animal
Sings to the wind, resting at sunset
In a mossy nest
Sensing moonlight in the air
(moonlight in the air)
Good clear water friend of wilderness
Sees in the pool her own reflection
In another world
Someone over there is counting
Fish in a sunbeam
In eggshell seas
Fish in a sunbeam
Eggshell finish
Natures lover climbs the primrose hill
Smiles at the sky watching the sunset
From a mossy nest
As she falls asleep she's counting
Fish in a sunbeam
In eggshell seas
Fish in a sunbeam
Eggshell finish
As she falls asleep she's counting
Fish in a sunbeam
In eggshell seas
Fish in a sunbeam
Eggshell finishI have always needed somebody girl
But I close the doors to keep out the world
But for you, I would be here all alone
Locked in a photograph
All of the clocks have run down
Lover beware
We'll be the lovers that never were
I hang patiently on every word you send
Will we ever be much more than just friends?
As for you, you sit there playing this game
You keep me waiting
When all of the clocks have run down
All over the world
We'll be the lovers that never were
For as long as the sun shines in somebody's eyes
I believe in you baby, so don't tell me lies
For as long as the trees throw down blossoms and leaves
I know there will be a parade of unpainted dreams
And I know dear, how much it's going to hurt
If you still refuse to get your hands dirty
So you, you must tell me something... I love you
Say goodbye or anything
All of the clocks have run down
Time's at an end
If we can't be lovers we'll never be friends
For as long as the sun shines in somebody's eyes
I believe in you baby, so don't tell me lies
For as long as the trees throw down blossoms and leaves
I know there will be a parade of unpainted dreamsCrash bang wallop i'm a lover again

For me to say what I'm about to say
Could take a bit of courage
But I can summon up enough of this and maybe more
Without your love I know I'd find it difficult
No reason to continue
So how can anyone live not knowing what love is?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before
I don't wanna think about it anyhow
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before
We don't have to talk about it
No, not now
Need a lie, when I don't have to lie
It get me into trouble
And I've been keepin' out of trouble for a long time now
So this is true, it's me for you eternity
Can go and last forever?
But while we're taking our time
I pity those that love left behind
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before?
I don't wanna think about it anyhow, anyhow?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before?
We don't have to talk about it
Oh, not now?
Talk about it now?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before?
I don't wanna think about it, think about it anyhow ?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before
I don't have to talk about it no, not now??
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before?
I don't wanna think about it think about it anyhow?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before
We don't have to talk about it
No, not now
I don't wanna talk about it, no, not nowBig boys bickering
That's what they're doin' ev'ryday
Big boys bickering
Fuckin' it up for ev'ryone, ev'ryone
Guess while they're betting on the track
They're tryin' to win your money back
All of the taxes that you paid
Went to fund a masquerade
Big boys bickering
That's what they're doin' all the day
Big boys bickering
Fuckin' it up in ev'ry way, ev'ry way
We stand here waiting
Underneath the tower block
Who will win and who will lose?
Which way do the big boys choose?
Which of us will never know what goes on?
(Who will win, who will lose?)
So while they argue through the night
Shakin' their sticks of dynamite
Babies are dying through the day
They wanna blow us all away
Big boys bickering
And so the game goes on and on
Big boys bickering
Fucking it up for ev'ryone, for ev'ryone
For ev'ryone, for ev'ryone, for ev'ryone
For ev'ryone, ev'ryone

I don't wanna know no more
Head to toe, from top to bottom I've been kicked around
Don't wanna be kicked around no more
I'll be thinking of you when you go
Take a walk along the shore
Why should I pretend that nothing is the matter now?
Don't wanna be kicked around no more
My life could be so sweet
I can't remember when I started running
The water underneath the bridge can't keep a secret
She's still running home
Take my blessing with you when you go
To the next one you adore, ooh
Head to toe, and top to bottom I've been kicked around
Ain't gonna be kicked around no more
Don't wanna be kicked around
Ain't gonna be kicked around

The water underneath the bridge can't keep a secret

Take my blessing with you when you go
I don't wanna know no more
Head to toe, from top to bottom I've been kicked around
Don't wanna be kicked around no more
Don't wanna be kicked around
Ain't gonna be kicked around
Don't wanna be kicked around no moreI know something you don't know
I want you to listen to the tale
I know a reasonable woman
Handsome and witty, yet a friend
She's got the right amount of passion
She isn't into rumour
Not too serious or too dumb
And equal mixture of good humour
And sweet, sweet memories, (ah, sweet memories)
Sweet, sweet memories
Sweet memories
Sweet, sweet, memories
She's got sweet, sweet memories
Sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories
Has she got any faults then?
Yes, she has one I must admit
When all the world tries to praise her
She refuses to hear it
She's got the right amount of passion
She isn't into rumour
Not too serious or too dumb
And equal mixture of good humour
And sweet, sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories

Sweet, memories

Taking me back
Taking me backEv'ry time I see you
Admit into something new
Doing unimportant things
All the foolish things that other people do
Ev'rything I'm trying
Doesn't feel quite right
And I can't help wondering
Why I ever let you out of my sight
So I keep coming back to love, wo-oh
Yes, I keep coming back to love
Must I keep moving along this track?
I might get restless
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Because I keep coming back to love
Ev'rywhere I get to, (oo-oo-oo)
I'm always on my own
Tryin' to solve a mystery
And if it was up to me I wouldn't be alone
Anytime I miss you, (ah-ah)
The feeling is so strong
But the road I'm travelling
Is filled with echoes of your sweet song
So I keep coming back to love, wo-oh
Yes, I keep coming back to love, wo-oh
Must I keep moving along this track?
If I get restless
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Because I keep coming back to love
Oo -
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to

Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to"I'm all alone," said she
"No one to phone, no one to touch me"
"I'm on my way," said the man in the long leather coat
As he started his car
"I'm glad you came," said she
"You got my note, you understood it"
He smiled as he hung up his long leather coat
On the back of the door
Stroll on baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of ev'rything in sight
Let the party begin
Stroll on baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of ev'rything in sight
Let the party begin
Oh, I love your coat, said she (oh, I love your coat, said she)
He said, well, thank you (he said, well, thank you)
In your note you said you had (in your note you said you had)
No one to touch you (no one to touch you)
So shall I go through? (so shall I go, so shall I go
So shall I go, so shall I go)
Why, yes, she said, you can go on ahead
She took out the key
And she locked him into the bedroom
Oh, oh, oh
Now I am alone, said she
She took a can of really red paint
And she sprayed up and down on the long leather coat
On the bloody red floor
So long, baby, I took you in
Just to show you that your long leather coat
Is really nothing but a handful of skin
Stroll on, baby, step right in
Help yourself to a handful of ev'rything in sight
Let the party begin!
Let the party begin! ho!
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Well, let the party, the party beginShe's got an american accent
From her head to her toes
If she's involved in an accident
You wouldn't see her underclothes
She is perfectly spotless
A fact that sticks out a mile
But people have got more talent
But this little lady's got style
Style, style
See her when she's walking
She's got style, style
Even when she's making me say
Ooooh-oo
Ooooh hey hey
Ooooh
She was born on the wrong side
Of these imaginary tracks
That used to divide each other
Into two convenient packs
She became a survivor
Always armed with a smile
You've only have to look at her picture to know
That this little lady's got style
Style, style
See her when she's talking
Style, style
Even when she's staying her place
As an only child
In a hostile world
Her only chance
Was to run away
Yeah yeah woh
Ooh
She's got style, style
See her when she's walking
She's got style, woh, style
Even when she's talking away
Oh style, yeah, style
I see her when she's talking
She's got style, style
Even when she's staying her place
Oooh, way
Ooh, oh, yeah, ooh, ooh, yeahIt's a tug of war
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
We expected more
But with one thing and another
We were trying to outdo each other
In a tug of war
In another world
In another world we could
Stand on top of the mountain
With our flag unfurled
In a time to come
In a time to come we will be
Dancing to the beat played
On a different drum
It's a tug of war
Though I know I mustn't grumble
It's a tug of war
But I can't let go
If I do you'll take a tumble
And the whole thing is going to crumble
It's a tug of war
(Pushing and pushing, pulling and pulling
Pushing and pulling)
In years to come they may discover
What the air we breathe and the life we lead
Are all about
But it won't be soon enough
Soon enough for me
No it won't be soon enough
Soon enough for me
In another world we could
Stand on top of the mountain
With our flag unfurled
In a time to come we will be
Dancing to the beat played
On a different drum
We will be dancing to the beat
Played on a different drum
We will be dancing to the beat
Played on a different drum
It's a tug of war
(A tug of war, a tug of war)
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
We expected more
But with one thing and another
We were trying to outscore each other
In a tug of war
(Pushing and pushing
Pulling and pulling
Pushing and pulling)Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around
Lonely driver
Out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor
Carrying the load
Switches on his radio
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around
Mmmm
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around
In the audience
Watching the show
With a paper in his hand
(In his hand, in his hand)
Some important impresario
Has a message for the band
Oh!
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
(Down, down)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around
You never know who may be
Listening to you
(Never know who may be listening to you)
(You never know who may be listening to you)
Take it away
Take it away
After hours
Late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Faded flowers
Wade in the jar
Till the evening is complete
(Hah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!)When your body is coming apart at the seams
And the whole thing's feeling low
You're convincing yourself that there's nobody there, I know
I know how you feel
Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car
When you had somewhere to go
Well it's annoying, not going to get very far, I know
But somebody cares
There's always someone, somewhere
You should know by now
Always somebody who cares
It's happening day in, day out
Well you know by now
Always somebody who cares
And if you don't know it, how will it find you?
How will we know your whereabouts?
But I know how you feel
I know how you feel
Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car
When you had somewhere to go
Well it's frustrating, not going to get very far, I know
But somebody cares
There's always someone, somewhere
You should know by now
Always somebody who cares
It's happening day in, day out
Well you know by now
Always somebody who cares
And if you don't know it, how will it find you?
How will we know your whereabouts?
But I know how you feelGood morning
Or good afternoon?
Good night
What's that you're doing?
Girl I like what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
'Cause it makes no kind of sense to me
You can make me feel so proud
You can make me holler ow!
Girl you make me want to dance and sing
My mind is blown and you're to blame
I say it's sunning when there's rain
I jump by leaps and bounds, just call my name
What's that you're saying?
Girl I likes the way you talk to me
What's that you're saying?
Even if it's wrong girl I do agree
Girl you make me feel so small
Though I might stand six feet tall
What you've got cuts me right down to size
I'll be the last, you'll be the first
I'll do my best to quench your thirst
I'm the lucky one who keeps the prize
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
'Cause I like what you
Do to me, do to me
Do it some more
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it some more
Do you know that I'm appreciating
What you do to me?
What's that you're doing?
Girl I like what you do to me, ooh
What's that you're doing?
'Cause it makes no kind of sense to me
You can fill my appetite
Without me taking up a bite
Never knew that love could fill you up
You're much too good for me to pass
I'm for the taking, you just ask
We can make it stick with love and luck
Girl, I like what you're doing
(Girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby do it some more
Girl, I like what you're doing
(Girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby, do it some more
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it some more
You know I like what you're doing
Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby, do it some more
What's that you're doing?
What's that I'm feeling?
That sensation's such a mystery
I know that it's thrilling
And I hope this feeling lasts eternally
Girl, you make me scream and shout
Tell me what it's all about
You make me give in without a fight
I don't have no words to say
You can fill it anyway
And everything you do will turn out right
Girl, I like what you're doing
Come on baby, do it some more
Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
We love you yeah yeah yeah
We love you yeah yeah yeah yeah
Baby, do it some more
Girl, I like what you're doing
When it's one o'clock, when it's two o'clock
When three, when four, when five o'clock
When it's seven o'clock, when it's eight o'clock
Nine and ten and eleven o'clock
When it's one o'clock, when it's two o'clock
Girl, I like what you're doingAnd if I said I really knew you well
What would your answer be
If you were here today?
Ooh ooh ooh, here today
Well, knowing you
You'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart
If you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, here today
But as for me, I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Ooh, ooh
What about the time we met? (What about the time we met?)
Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get
Didn't understand a thing, but we could always sing
What about the night we cried? (What about the night we cried?)
Because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside
Never understood a word, but you were always there with a smile
And if I say I really loved you and was glad you came along
When you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, for you were in my song
Ooh ooh ooh, here todayWell I used to smile when I was a pup
Sailing down the Nile in a china cup
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out of my back pocket
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom
Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got what I got from ballroom dancing
Big B.D
Well I used to fly when I was a kid
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit
On a carpet ride to a foreign land
At the time of Davy Crockett
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom
Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing
Big B.D
Well it went so fast and we all grew up
Now the days that passed in the china cup
Are the memories of another day
And I wouldn't want to knock it
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom
Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing
Big B.D
Oh!The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appalling
The mark is holding, the franc is fading
The drachma's very weak, but everyone's still trading
The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors
Well, I fear, my dear, that it's eminently clear
That you can't see the trees for the forest
Your father was an extraordinary man
But you don't seem to have inherited many of his mannerisms
Oh, any of his mannerisms
The dollar's moving, the ruble's rising
The yen is keeping up, which hardly seems surprising
The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the stout are survivors
Hear me, my lover (Hear me lover)
I can't be held responsible now (Oh no, it wasn't me)
For something that didn't happen (I didn't do it anyway)
I knew you for a minute
Oh, it didn't happen only for a minute
Your heart just wasn't in it anymore
Mmm, hmm
The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appallingLight out wanderlust
Head us out to sea
Captain says there'll be a bust
This one's not for me
Take us from the dark
Out where we can see
Captain's out to make his mark
This one's not to be
Light out wanderlust
Help us to be free
Light out wanderlust
Do it just for me
Wanderlust
Oh where did I go wrong, my love?
What petty crime was I found guilty of?
What better time to find a brand new day?
Oh - wanderlust away

Once I had a little Spanish guitar
The neighbours told me I could go pretty far
Well I came and I went
And my guitar got bent
But I discovered that the people who love
Are what we need if we're to get up above it all
And that's that
Unless the world is flat
I want to get it mm mm
I want to get it just in case
It doesn't come around again
I want to get it mm mm
I want to get it and I wanna get it good
Pardon me if I've been misunderstood
I want to get it while the going is good
The telephone rang
About a song I sang
The life of Cadillac and ultra for sure
Is automatic for a lady demure
She came and she went
Without a single dent

Is now the one you see
The one you wanted to be
Is now the one you seeYou can dress me up as a robber
But I won't be in disguise
Only love is a robber
And he lives within your eyes
Ooh, ooh eee ooh
You can dress me up as a sailor
But I'll never run to sea
As long as your love is available to me
What do I do with a sea of blue?
Ooh, eee ooh
Dressing me up
It doesn't make a difference
What you want to do
Whichever way you look at it
I'm still in love with you
If we go on forever
I may never make a change
Dressing me up
And if I don't convince you
You needn't look too far
To see that I'm not lying
'Cause I love you the way you are
And what's the point of changing
When I'm happy as I am?
Well you can dress me up as a soldier
But I wouldn't know what for
I was the one that told you he loved you
Don't want to go to another war
No, no, noEbony and ivory

Can I get you to slip me the answer?
Can I get you to show me a little of your mime?
You were always a very good dancer
I'd be happy to show you a bit of what I found
I'd be happy to share in its beauty
I'd be happy to lay low, inevitably bound

I was thinking about that summer so long ago
Pack up your bags and yell, "Geronimo!"
That was a golden summer, wasn't it hot?
We laughed a lot that summer, laughed a lot
Laughing at the good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in
There was something about the weather, what can I say?
Nothing like any other holiday
That was a silly season, was it the best?
We didn't need a reason, just a rest
Happy at the good times coming
Happy at the good times coming in
Good times coming, happy at the good times coming in
I'm loving you, I'm loving you, I'm loving you now
I'm loving you, I'm loving you, I'm loving you now
There was a golden summer before the war
They laughed a lot that summer, la de dah
Laughing at the good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming, laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in

Sleazy instruments, half talked, half baked ideas
Dad, you didn't say O.K.!
The window was open, outside was a spaceship
(A master can highlight the phrases)
It took off into the sky, leaving a trail of smoke behind it...
Short of the standard, was it the sun?
What was rehearsal? Conventional drum?
Not quite a hundred, less than a ton
Clearly the time came, the plan had begun

(Talk, more talk)It's beautiful outside, an old hand gathers wood
Can he see me sitting here? His mind is somewhere else
His friends have flown away, he's left out in the cold
He won't sit by my fire, he says he likes it in the snow
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow
It's getting dark outside, the old hand's going home
Has he someone waiting there? Or is he living on his own?
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow
White blanket, hiding the traces of tears she didn't see
Oh white blanket covers the memory
Of all that used to be, all that used to be
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way
He can't help feeling that she might come back someday
It's beautiful outside, a magpie looks for food
The old hand throws a crumb
Do you think he's found a friend?
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow
White blanket, hiding the traces of paths he didn't take
Oh white blanket covers the memory
Of moves he didn't make
Oh white blanket, hiding the traces of tears she didn't see
Snow white blanket simply covers the memory
Of all that used to be
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way
He can't help feeling that she might come back somedayAnd if you take your love away from me
I'm only going to want it back
I'll probably pretend I didn't see
But knowing me, I'll want you back again, and again
Till the word has lost it's meaning
And love is all that stays
Only love remains
If you should ever feel that something's wrong
I'm gonna wanna put it right
To bring a happy ending to our song
I'll carry on believing in a love
If your love was to trickle through my fingers
What would it leave me with?
Only love remains
(Only love, love remains)
Only love (remains)
Old enough and strong enough to stretch across the world
Taking the sand inside an oyster, changing it into a pearl
Making another magic transformation
Find the right boy for the right girl
When all our friends have gone and we're alone
There's nothing left to shout about
Together we'll explore the great unknown
I'd say we won't be going out tonight
Let tonight be the one that we remember
When love is all that stays
Only love remains
When love is all that stays (Only love, love remains)
Only love remains
Only love remainsSay one, say two, say three
Darling, I love you very, very, very much
And I really am relying on your touch
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin
Maybe we could hit upon a word
Something that the others haven't heard
When you want me to love you
Just tell me to press
Right there, that's it, yes
Oh when you feel the stress, don't just stand there
Tell me to press
You can give me what I want I must confess
My body needs attention, my mind is in a mess
Oklahoma was never like this
Never like this, it was never like this
Ever like this, say was it ever like this?
Oklahoma was never like this
Oh it was never like this
Darling, I know it really wouldn't be a crime
If I say I want to love you all the time
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin
Maybe we should have a secret code
Before we both get ready to explode
When you want me to love you
Well just tell me to press
(Tell me to press)
Right there, that's it, yes
When you feel the stress
Don't just stand there
Tell me to press

I was pedaling down the road
When I saw Nell Gwynne and her oranges
And said "I'll have one of those"
She said "Move over, busker
Don't bang your drum
Move over, busker
Your time will come"
Well I was hanging around for a miracle
Struggling with a rhyme
When I saw Mae West in a sweaty vest
And I said "I'll come up and see you sometime"
She said "Move over, busker
That's not my style
Your chance is coming
In a little while"
We've got it coming, come on, come on
We've got it coming, coming to you
We've got it coming, come on, come on
We've got it coming, coming to you
Well, I've been waiting
But I'm impatient
No-one can hold me back
I want to stay with the action
But I won't get it
My great illusion
Will vanish anyhow
If I don't grab it now
Well, I was hacking my way through the undergrowth
Juggling with my pride
When I saw Errol Flynn in a tiger skin
And I said, "You look satisfied!"
Well, he looked down at me from his motor home
And he gave me a dirty smile
He said "Well, yes, I am but she's calling me
Would you excuse us for a while?"
Move over, busker
Your day is done
Move over, busker
My time has come
I'm telling you to
Move over, busker (Come on, come on)
I'll bang my drum (Come on, come on)
Move over, busker
My time has come
(You've got it coming, coming to you)
Move over, busker (Come on, come on)
Your day is done (Come on, come on)
Move over, busker
My time has come
(You've got it coming, coming to you)What the hell gives the right to tell me what to do with my
Life?
Especially when you made a mess of every chance you had to
Success
Look at you... Just look at you. I said I'm angry just
Looking at you
I'm sick and tired of sitting back listening to all of
Your clap-trap
If you could get me to take the rap I guarantee
You'd leave me with a backslap
Push me to the left, push me to the right try to take me
Out of the way
Even if you kick me off the edge of the world
You're still going to hear me say
Shouting down again Mahama
Shouting down again
I can't begin to tell you all the reasons
Why you're making me crazy
I've got so many answers
Like you're stupid, like you're crooked, like you're lazy
Hit me with your left, hit me with your right
Hit me from the top to the toe
Even when you chew me up and spit me out
I'm still going to want to knowEars twitch, like a dog
Breaking eggs in a dish
Do not mock me when I say
This is not a lie
It's a funny thing, half serious
With our hands on our ears
Living dreams with mouths ajar
Wide awake, we go to sleep
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem
Something special between us
When we made love the game was over
I couldn't say the words
Words wouldn't get my feelings through
So I keep talking to you
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
Custom made dinosaurs
Too late now, for a change
Everything is under the sun
But nothing is for keeps
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... that may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd, however absurd,... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seemYou need love, write a letter, you need love write away
Get it down, you'll feel better, send it now, write away
Hey Cinderella, did you need that other fella?
On the wrong side of midnight your defences slipped away
You need attention, so I think it's worth a mention
That if I can deliver
Well there wouldn't be no heavy price to pay
You need love so write a letter, you need love, write away
If you need to feel better do it now, write away
Hey Margarita, I can't think of nothing sweeter
But the taste of your nectar seems to leave the boys astray
Don't you forget it, well you know you won't regret it
I've got the answer, you were looking at it long before today
You need love so write a letter, you need love write away
Get it down, you'll feel better, send it now, write away
You need love, love, love, write a letter
You need love, write away
If you need to feel better, do it now, now, now write awayIt's not true!
It's not true!

Some people say she's a bad girl
Some people think she's a fool
Some people tell me she's no good

No saying what she might do
Some people tell me she's crazy

Ooh, ooh, ooh, they've been talking to the fellas
Ooh, ooh, ooh, have they never heard of jealousy?

What they're saying about her isn't true
Don't you know it isn't true?
It's not trueYou don't feel right when I come on strong
Don't get it wrong
I wait all night but you won't be long
Don't get it wrong
Hear me right
I love you from the bottom of my heart
You make the answer bright
You touch me in a way that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you
And if you're tempted to tell a lie
Don't get it wrong
Well it breaks my heart when I see you cry
Don't get it wrong
Get it right
The brightest light that's shining in the skies
Is shining from your eyes
I love you in a way, that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you
I'm often accused of giving too little
It's got me confused, I'm split down the middle
Conflicting reviews of our life coming in
It's tough on a tightrope, yes it's tough on a tightrope
Hear me right
I love you from the bottom of my heart
You make the answer bright
You touch me in a way that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you
Tough on a tightropePicking up scales and broken chords
Puppy dog tails in the house of lords
Tell me darling, what can it mean?
Making up moons in a minor key
What have those tunes got to do with me?
Tell me darling, where have you been?
Once upon along ago
Children searched for treasure
Nature's plan went hand in hand with pleasure
Such pleasure
Blowing balloons on a windy day
Desolate dunes with a lot to say
Tell me darling, what have you seen?
Once upon along ago
Children searched for treasure
Nature's plan went hand in hand with pleasure
Such pleasure
Playing guitars on an empty stage
Counting the bars of an iron cage
Tell me darling, what can it mean?
Picking up scales and broken chords
Puppy dog tails in the house of lords
Tell me darling, what does it mean?

How we did it no one knows
I guess we must have had what it took

She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"
And so I said so long Yvonne
When I first saw Yvonne, volcanoes erupted
And laughter flowed into my life
She seemed all right, nothing wrong
Everything about her was so strong
But I know no one’s gonna keep us apart
Yvonne’s the one I’ve been counting on
She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"
And so I said so long Yvonne
When I saw her again, I was caught in a landslide
But I didn’t dare let it show
Her ruby lips were teasing me
But jealousy would never let us be
So always gonna keep us apart
She never knew how much I loved her
I never got to tell her
We never found a way to say farewell
Yvonne
Yvonne
When I last saw Yvonne, she was covered in roses
But sadness had ended her life
She walked so tall, she looked so tan
Everything about her was so grand
But what you get is not what you see
So long, Yvonne, you’re not fooling me
Yvonne, Yvonne’s the one I’ve been counting on
She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"
And so I said so long Yvonne
Yvonne, Yvonne’s the one I’ve been counting on
She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"

All I need is a pint a day if I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here

When your bus has left the stop, you'd better drop your hurrying
What's the use of hurrying?
Leave me alone, Mrs. Vandebilt
I've got plenty of time of my own
What's the use of worrying?

No use!

The rain comes falling from the sky
To fill the stream that fills the sea
And that's where life began for you and me
So the next time you see rain it ain't bad
Don't complain, it rains for you
The next time you see L.A. rain clouds
Don't complain, it rains for you and me
Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia

It might have been a bright blue day
But rain clouds had to come this way
They're watering everything that they can see
A seed is waiting in the earth
For rain to come and give him birth
It's all he really needs to set him free
So the next time you see L.A. rain clouds
Don't complain, it rains for you
So lay down your umbrellas
Strip off your plastic macs
You've never felt the rain my friend
Till you've felt it running down your back
So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad
Don't complain, it rains for you
The next time you see L.A. rain clouds
Don't complain, it rains for you and me

I'm not surprised that your black eyes are gazing
You say that love is everything, and what we need the most of
I wish you knew, that's just how true my love was
No words for my love
Your burning love, sweet burning love
It's deep inside
You must not hide your burning love
Sweet burning love, your burning love
You want to turn your head away, and someone's thinking of you
I wish you'd see it's only me--I love you
No words for my loveSaid farewell to my last hotel, it never was much kind of abode
Glasgow town never brought me down when I was heading out on the road
Carlisle city never looked so pretty, and the Kendal freeway is fast
Slow down driver, wanna stay alive, I wanna make this journey last

M6 south down Liverpool, where they play the west coast sound
Sailor Sam, he came from Birmingham, but he never will be found

Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
And they're never gonna take her away
Got no time for a rum and lime, I wanna get my right foot down
Shake some dust off of this old bus, I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day upon the motorway, where the carburetors blast
Slow down driver, wanna stay alive, I wanna make this journey last
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
And they're never gonna take her away
Say bye-bye!

His paintings on the wall
Before he went, he bade us well
And said goodnight to us all

We're so sorry, but we haven't heard a thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But if anything should happen, we'll be sure to give a ring
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But the kettle's on the boil and we're so easily called away

Heart of the country

And the wind played a dreadful cantata (cantata, cantata)
Sore was I from the crack of an enemy's hose
And the horrible sound of tomato (tomato, tomato)
Ketchup (ketchup)
Soup and puree (soup and puree)
Don't get left behind (get left behind)
Ketchup (ketchup)
Soup and puree (soup and puree)
Don't get left behind
(Get left behind, get left behind, get left behind)
When a rattle of rats had awoken
The sinews, the nerves, and the veins
My piano is boldly outspoken
And attempts to repeat his refrain
So I stood with a knot in my stomach
And I gazed at that terrible sight
Of two youngsters concealed in a barrel

Honey, I want it my way
But listen to her daddy's song
"Don't stay out too long"
Ooh, we're just busy hiding
Sitting in the back seat of my car
Looking for a ride in the haul-about
Looking for a ride in and out of town
Stalling around in a haul-about
Looking for a ride in and out of
The lazy lights are pretty
We may end up in Mexico City
But listen to her daddy's song
"Making love is wrong"
Ooh, we're just busy riding
Sitting in the back seat of my car
Aw, we was only hiding
Sitting in the back seat of my car, yeah
And when we finish driving
We can say we were late in arriving
And listen to her daddy's song
We believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
We can make it to Mexico City
Sitting in the back seat of my car

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh, oh oh, yeah, oh, yeahI tried to get over you
I tried to find something new
But all i could ever do was fill my time
With thoughts of you
I tried to go somewhere old
To search for my pot of gold
But all i could ever hold inside my mind
Were thoughts of you
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms in a different style
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild again
Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again
Yeah!
Oh, lonely, lonely road
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms in a different style

To tell the through of what we've seen
And what we haven't found will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see
From a lover to a friend, take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be someone I can trust
Someone I believe
Ohh la la la
How can i walk when i can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All i want is to tell me
You're going to take it away
From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice, let me love again
Now that you turned out to be

Let me love againShe's given up talking, don't say a word
Even in the classroom, not a dickie bird
Unlike other children, she's seen and never heard
She's given up talking, don't say a word
You see her in the playground standing on her own
Everybody wonders why she's all alone
Someone made her angry, someone's got her scared
She's given up talking, don't say a word
But when she comes home, it's yap-a-yap-yap
Words are running freely like the water from a tap
Her brothers and her sisters can't get a word in edgeways
But when she's back at school again, she goes into a daze
But when she comes home, it's yap-a-yap-yap

Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again
If something's open, it's my heart
If something's missing, it's when we're apart
If something's good, it's when we're back together again
Nothing's wrong, it's just insane
Nothing's right until you're back again
Nothing's broken when it's softly spoken
And we're walking slowly down the lane
Why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane?
Go for a ride in the driving rain

You'd understand, and I would feel your love was true
This is all I want

If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
Those of us who notice are expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth
When i look in your eyes
I can see the sky shining down upon the perfect garden
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
Those of us who notice are expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth
You can't imagine just what i've been going through
I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you
I well remember when my heart was free
My soul could laugh, so could we
If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside

If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
All the world's a tiny bubble
All the world's a tiny bubbleThere must have been magic the night that we met
If I hadn't stopped you, I'd always regret
A few minutes later, you'd have been out that door
And i'd have been lonely forever more
Forever more
Oh what made us do it?
Under what holy spell?
Nature's mother knew it
Only too well
She reached out her fingers
To point at the sky
Leaving me helpless
Not knowing why
And this is the hour
That they turn out the light
Nothing but memories
Burning so bright
Burning so bright
Oh what made us do it?
Under what holy spell?
Nature's mother knew it
Only too well
There must have been magic the night that we met
If I hadn't stopped you, I'd always regret
There must have been magic
There must have been magic
There must have been magic the night that we metI like it, please don't take my heart away
It's happy where it is, so let it stay
You gave me love
You gave me what i wanted
You gave me love your way
I've seen it shining from the furthest stars
Like Venus saw it on the way to Mars
You gave me love
You gave me what i wanted
You gave me love your way
Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight
I like it, please don't take my heart away

You give me power to get out of bed
When in the morning I'm feeling dead
Living and loving there's a lot to be said
It's true
Going to say it about you
Say it about you
Out of the darkness and into the light
Straight to the centre of everything right
Darling, don't worry, the sky will be bright and blue
When I say it about you
Going to say it about you
I'll say it about you
When did you teach me to fly thru the air?
Sooner or later, we all will be there
I read the headlines, and now I can swear
It's true
And they said it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you

Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of
Because when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame

I'll be feeling blue just sitting here without you
You could be the one to chase my blues away
Away
So tell me how, how to reach your love

Red lights, green lights, strawberry wine
A good friend of mine follows the stars
Venus and Mars are alright tonightWhat's that man holding in his hand?
He looks a lot like a guy I knew way back when
It's Silly Willy with that Philly band
Could be, ooh-ee
Tell me, what's that man movin' cross the stage?
It looks a lot like the one used by Jimmy Page
It's like a relic from a different age
Could be, oo-ee
If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
They've got long hair at Madison Square
You've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah
The lights go down, they're back in town--O.K
Behind the stacks, you glimpse an axe
The tension mounts you score an ounce--ole!
The temperatures rise as you see the whites of their eyes
If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
You've got long hair at Madison Square
They've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah
In my green metal suit, I'm preparing to shoot up the city
And the ring at the end of my nose makes me look rather pretty
It's a pity there's nobody here to witness the end
Save for my dear old friend and confidante, mademoiselle Kitty
What's that man moving to and fro?
That decibel meter doesn't seem to be reading low
But they was louder at the Rainbow
Could be, ooh-ee
If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
They've got long hair at Madison Square
You've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah

My, you're so fine when love is mine
I can't go wrong

Happiness in the homeland

My eye cries out a tear still born misunderstanding

I love you and you, you seem to like me
Wherever we wander, the local folk agree
I love you and you, you seem to like me
Heading back to old familiar places
Places where the cobwebs blow away
I can't forget the airs and graces
Shall we dance?
This is fun
We should do this more often
You'll never be crowned by the aristocracy
To their delight, you'd merely invite them in for a cup of tea
And I love you and you
You seem to like
You seem to like
You seem to like meWell I was talking last night
Magneto and Titanium Man
We were talking about you, babe
They said
You was involved in a robbery
That was due to happen
At a quarter to three in the main street
I didn't believe them (I didn't believe them)
Magneto and Titanium Man
But when the Crimson Dynamo
Finally assured me, well, I knew
You was involved in a robbery
That was due to happen
At a quarter to three in the main street
So we went out
Magneto and Titanium Man
And the Crimson Dynamo
Came along for the ride
We went to town with the livery
And we swung all over that
Long tall bank in the main street
Well there she were and to my despair
She's a five-star criminal breaking the code
Magneto said, "Now the time has come
To gather our forces and run!"
Oh no
This can't be so
And then it occurred to me!
You couldn't be bad
Magneto was mad!
Titanium too!
The Crimson Dynamo just couldn't cut it no more
You were the law
We went to town with the livery
And we swung all over that
Long tall bank in the main street (You know the one I mean?)
Well there she were and to my despair
She's a five-star criminal breaking the code
Magneto said, "Now the time come
To gather our forces and run!"
Oh no
This can't be so
And then it occurred to me!
You couldn't be bad
Magneto was mad!
Titanium too!
And the Crimson Dynamo
Just couldn't cut it no more
You were the lawAh, she tastes like wine
Such a human being so divine
Oh, she feels like sun (Like sun)
Mother Nature look at what you've done
Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, she looks like snow
I wanna put her in a Broadway show
Ah, she'll dance and dine
Like a Lucifer she'll always shine
Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, oh, I feel like letting go
Oh (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, she sings it so
I want to put her on the radio
One day and there you are
Ladies and gentleman
A brand new star

Oh, I feel like letting goStanding in the hall

I can drive a Cadillac across the Irish Sea
But when I've finished doing that
I know where I'll want to be

You're breathing so hot
A lot of political nonsense in the air
You're making it hard
For the people who live in there
You're moving so fast
But, baby, you know not where

I'll be coming home to stay and it's so
Some people never know
Some people can sleep at nighttime
Believing that love is a lie
I'm only a person like you, love
And who in the world can be right
All the right time
I know I was wrong, make me right, right
Some people can sleep at nighttime
Believing that love is a lie
I'm only a person like you, love
And who in the world can be right
All the right time
I know I was wrong, make me right, right
Only love can stand the test
Only you outshine the rest
Only fools take second best, but it's so
Some people never know
Only love can stand the test
Only you outshine the rest
Only fools take second best, but it's so
Some people never knowYou are my love, you are my song, linger on
You are my song, I am your singer
You are my one, you are my own melody
You are my song, I am your singer
Someday when we're singing
We will fly away, going winging
Sing, singing my love song to you
Someday when we're singing
We will fly away, going winging
Sing, singing my love song to you
My song is sung
When day is done harmonies will linger on
I am your singer
I am your singer
Singing my love song to youOh, baby, don't you let me down tomorrow
Holding hands, we both abandon sorrow
Oh, for a chance to get away tomorrow
Hey, baby's got a lazy day on Sunday
Here's a pound, we hang around 'till Monday
Oh, baby don't you let me down on Sunday
Bring a bag of bread and cheese
And find a shady spot beneath the trees
Catch a breath of country air
And run your pretty fingers through my hair
Tomorrow, when we both abandon sorrow
Oh, baby, don't you let me down tomorrow
Through the week we beg and steal and borrow
Oh, for a chance to get away tomorrow
Honey, pray for sunny skies so I can speak to rainbows in your eyes
Let's just hope the weather man is feeling fine and doesn't spoil our plan
Tomorrow, when we both abandon sorrow
Oh, baby, don't you let me down tomorrow
Holding hands we both abandon sorrow
Oh, baby, don't you let me down tomorrow
Oh, for a chance to get away tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Baby, don't let me down tomorrow
Hey, don't let me down

Don't make them have to take it away
Give Ireland back to the Irish
Make Ireland Irish today
Great Britain you are tremendous
And nobody knows like me
But really what are you doing
In the land across the sea
Tell me how would you like it
If on your way to work
You were stopped by Irish soldiers
Would you lie down, do nothing?
Would you give in, or go berserk?
Give Ireland back to the Irish
Don't make them have to take it away
Give Ireland back to the Irish
Make Ireland Irish today
Great Britain and all the people
Say that all people must be free
Meanwhile, back in Ireland
There's a man who looks like me
And he dreams of god and country
And he's feeling really bad
And he's sitting in a prison
Say, should he lie down, do nothing?
Should he give in or go mad?
Give Ireland back to the Irish
Don't make them have to take it away
Give Ireland back to the Irish
Make Ireland Irish today

Don't make them have to take it away

I was accosted by a barker playing a simple tune upon his flute
Toot, toot, toot, toot
Silver rain was falling down upon the dirty ground of London town
People pass me by on my imaginary street
Ordinary people it's impossible to meet
Holding conversations that are always incomplete
Well, I don't know
Oh, where are there places to go?
Someone, somewhere has to know
I don't know
Out of work again, the actor entertains his wife
With the same old stories of his ordinary life
Maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife
Well, I don't know
Oh, where are there places to go?
Someone, somewhere has to know
Crawling down the pavement on a Sunday afternoon
I was arrested by a rozzer wearing a pink balloon about his foot
Toot, toot, toot, toot
Silver rain was falling down upon the dirty ground of London town
Someone, somewhere has to know
Silver rain was falling down upon the dirty ground of London townCafe on the left bank, ordinary wine
Touching all the girls with your eyes
A tiny crowd of Frenchmen 'round a tv shop
Watching Charles de Gaulle make a speech
Dancing after midnight, sprawling to the car
Continental breakfast in the bar
English-speaking people drinking German beer
Talking far too loud for their ears
Cafe on the left bank, ordinary wine
Touching all the girls with your eyes
Dancing after midnight, crawling to the car
Cocktail waitress waiting in the bar
English-speaking people drinking German beer

Sailing songs, wailing on the moon
And we were sailing songs, wailing on the moon
We were wailing on the moonI know a tiny waterfall
A magic little place
Where we can play together
And watch the fishes race
Children children where are you
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain
I hope you're not too far away
For me to see again
I know where there's a fairy
Who will invite us all to tea
But she won't let me in alone
You'll have to come with me
Children children where are you
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain
I hope you're not too far away
For me to see again
Start all over again

Where we can play together
And watch the fishes race

We can make this whole damn thing work out
With a little love we can lay it down
Can't you feel the town exploding?
There is no end to what we can do together (Together)
There is no end (There is no end, there is no end)
The willow turns his back on inclement weather
And if he can do it, we can do it just me and you
And a little luck we can clear it up
We can bring it in for a landing
With a little luck we can turn it on
There can be no misunderstanding
There is no end to what we can do together (Together)
There is no end (There is no end, there is no end)
The willow turns his back on inclement weather
We can do it, just me and you
With a little push we could set it off
We can send it rocketing skywards
With a little love we could shake it up
Don't you feel the comet exploding?

Woh oh, wooAll stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me
Behold the famous groupies, they are alike as two peas
And where the other goes, the other goes
But though the famous groupies are only paid in rupees
Nobody knows what the famous groupies know
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go
There was a bongo player who kept an extra layer
Of Dunlopillo mattress in his van
But when the famous groupies arrived with their twin snoopies
Nobody saw which way the poor boy ran
As nobody does it like a famous groupie can
All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me
There was a lead guitarist who lived in Epping Forest
And all he ever wanted was to blow
(Who knows why but)
But when the girls were with him he never lost his rhythm
'Cause nobody knows what the famous groupies know
(alright, girls?)
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go
There was the classic story of a roadie nicknamed Rory
Who used to practice voodoo on the side
But when the famous twosome suggested something gruesome
All that they found was a crater two miles wide
Which left the music business absolutely horrified
All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies
Ladies and gentlemen, those magnificent examples of female pulchritude and luminosity, direct from their global perambulations to the very boards of this supremely magnificent proscenium arch
Ladies and gentlemen I give you, famous groupies!Well, the rain was a-failing, and the ground turned to mud
I was watching all the people running from the flood
So I started to praying, though I ain't no praying man
For the Lord to come-a-helping, knowing He'd understand
Deliver your children to the good good life
Give 'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong, you'd better make it right
Well, I had me a woman, she was good and clean
She spent all the day with the washing machine
But when it come to loving, she was never around
She was out getting dirty all over town
Deliver your children to the good good life
Give 'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong, you'd better make it right
Well, I was low on money, and my truck broke down
I was on my way to the lost and found
So I took it to a dealer, I said "make it run"
Well, I ain't got no money, but I got me a gun
I said you robbed me before, so I'm robbing you back
And if it don't put you straight, it'll put you on the right track
Well, I ain't no devil, and I ain't no saint
But I can tell a dealer by the colour of his paint
Deliver your children to the good good life
Give 'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong, you'd better make it right
Deliver your children to the good good life
Give 'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong, you'd better make it right
If you want good eggs, you gotta feed that hen
And if you want to hear some more, well, I'll sing it againOoh, our love affair was over on the second day
You packed a bag, and like a birdie flew away
Meanwhile, I'm sitting here, I'm getting in a mess
If you want my love, leave your name and address
Ooh, well, I used to love you baby, when I was your man
But maybe loving you is something no one man can do
Meanwhile I'm sitting here, I'm getting in a mess
If you want my love, leave your name and address
Love to feel the tingle of your heavenly caresses
Love to intermingle, a lonely single without addresses
If you want my love, leave your name and address
Ah if it's all over baby, you know I'll understand
Maybe I'll hate to think of you with another man
Meanwhile I'm sitting here, I'm getting in a mess
If you want my love, leave your name and address
Ooh but if it's all over baby, you know I'll understand
Maybe I'll hate to think of you with another man
Meanwhile I'm sitting here, I'm getting in a mess
If you want my love, leave your name and address
Ooh but if it's all over baby, you know I'll understandThough some things in life are hard to bear
Don't let it bring you down
Should the sand of time run out on you
Don't let it bring you down
Don't go down, don't go underground
Things seem strange, but they change
How they change
Up and down your carousel will go
So don't let it bring you down
Don't go down, don't get out of town
Get to know how it goes (go-o-oes)
How it goes (go-o-oes)
When the price you have to pay is high
Don't let it bring you down
Ooh, don't let it bring you downRight on down at the bottom of the sea
Tell me are you receiving me?
My name is Morse Moose and I'm calling you
Right on down at the bottom of the sea
Tell me are you receiving me?
My name is Morse Moose and I'm calling you
The Grey Goose was a steady boat
People said she's never float
One night when the moon was high
The Grey Goose flew away
As we were sailing 'round the rocks
The mate took out his compass box
And said the wind is like a fox
But the Grey Goose flew away
When out upon the open sea
The admiral, the mate and me
Prepared to face eternity
But the Grey Goose flew away
She flew into the stormy sea
Davy Jones was calling me
But heading for tranquility
The Grey Goose flew away
Right on down to the bottom of the sea
Tell me are you receiving me?

Though she never gave an answer
He used to follow her all about
Still, she couldn't shake him
She didn't seem to make her mind up
'Til he took her to the waterspout
Love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Woody wouldn't do it
But they said that he never blew it
He didn't know what was hanging out
'Til he got an answer
Out of daddy's dancer
When she took him to the waterspout
She said love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Only love can get you at it and in a minute
You will find yourself swimming in it

And take your breath away
Make you wanna say what you're thinking of
It's only love down at the bottom
Down at the bottom of the waterspout
Love comes in, love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Daddy couldn't stand it
Said Woody was a bad bandit
And they were knocking each other out
'Til the little dancer
Came up with another answer
She took them to the waterspout
Said love comes in, she said love comes out
At the bottom, at the bottom of the waterspout
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, Mull of Kintyre
Far have I travelled and much have I seen
Dark distant mountains with valleys of green
Past painted deserts the sunsets on fire
As he carries me home to the Mull of Kintyre
Mull of Kintyre
Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, Mull of Kintyre
Sweep through the heather like deer in the glen
Carry me back to the days I knew then
Nights when we sang like a heavenly choir
Of the life and the times of the Mull of Kintyre
Mull of Kintyre
Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, Mull of Kintyre
Smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain
Still take me back to where my memories remain
Flickering embers grow higher and higher
As they carry me back to the Mull of Kintyre
Mull of Kintyre
Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, Mull of Kintyre

Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it isn't too late
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past
I've got too much on my mind
I think of everything to be discovered
I hope there's something to find
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past
The things I think I did
I do, I think I did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid
I couldn't understand a word that they were saying
But still I hung around and took it all in
I wouldn't join in with the games that they were playing
It went by, it went by, in a flash
It flew by, it flew by, in a flash
I've got too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it's never too late
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past

When I was a kid

They want you in the front line (so fine so fine)

She picks up daisies from a field
She loves to weave them in her hair
I know she knows it isn't real
She still hears music in the air
It's coming from inside her heart
I hope it lasts forever
The sun is shining in the sky
She wants to dance around the world
And though I'd love to be the guy
That gets to walk off with the girl
I'll go along with all she needs
And it will be my pleasure
She makes me feel glad, I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her

Of a dirty airport town
What was I doing on the road to ruin?
Well, my mama laid me down
My mama laid me down
Around my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying, left to die
In this godforsaken place
This godforsaken place
Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows
I'm passing through, I'm on my way
On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through, no fixed abode
And that is why I need to try to hold on
I've got to hold on
I've got to hold on
Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she live in disgrace?
Well, I never, will I ever see my father's face?
See my father's face?
Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows (only Mama knows)
Only Mama knows (only Mama knows)
(Only Mama knows)
(Only Mama knows)
I've got to hold on
I've got to hold on
Got to hold onA-one, two, three
When was that summer when the skies were blue?
The bright red cardinal flew down from his tree
You tell me
When was that summer when it never rained?
The air was buzzing with the sweet old honeybee
Let's see
You tell me
Were we there? Was it real?
Is it truly how I feel?
Maybe
You tell me
Ooh
Were we there?
Was it real?
Is it truly how I feel?
Maybe
You tell me
When was that summer of a dozen words?
The butterflies and hummingbirds flew free
Let's see
You tell me
Let's see
You tell meI'm not coming down no matter what you do
I like it up here without you
Go light, Mr. Bellamy
We'll have you down soon
No one to tell me what to do
No one to hold my hand
Bellamy's got a lot to do
And I hope that you'll understand
Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand
Steady, lads
And easy does it
Ooooh, don't frighten him!
Here we go
I'm not coming down no matter what you say
I like it up here anyway
Sit tight, Mr. Bellamy
This shouldn't take long
In the delusionary state
No wonder he's been feeling strange of late
Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand
Steady, lads
And easy does it
Don't frighten him!
Here we go
Here we go
I'm not coming down no matter what you do
I like it up here without youGratitude, gratitude
Gratitude
I'm so grateful for everything you've ever given me
How can I explain what it means to be loved by you?
By you, loved by you
Loved by you
Show my gratitude, gratitude
Show my gratitude
I want to show my gratitude, gratitude
Yeah
Well, I was lonely, I was living with a memory
But my cold and lonely nights ended when you sheltered me
Loved by you, I was loved by you
Yeah, I was loved by you
I want to show my gratitude, gratitude
Yeah, show my gratitude to you
Gratitude, show my gratitude to you
Mmm, yeah
I should stop loving you
Think what you put me through
But I don't want to lock my heart away
I will look forward to days when I'd be loving you
Until then, gonna wish and hope and pray
Ya ya ya ya ya!
I want to show my gratitude, gratitude
I want to show my gratitude, show my
Yeah my gratitude
To be loved by you, be loved by you
Loved by you, to be loved by you
Gratitude

GratitudeDon't live in the past
Don't hold on to something that's changing fast
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
We jump up for joy
Who cares if we look like a girl or boy?
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
A little more, a little tall
Check the rack
What went out is coming back
Don't live in the past
Don't hold on to something that's changing fast
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes

Check the rack
What went out, is coming backThat was me at the scout camp, in the school play
Spade and bucket by the sea
That was me
That was me playing conkers at the bus stop
On a blanket in the blue bells
That was me
The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life that's pretty hard to take it in
That was me
Well, that was me, royal iris, on the river
Mersey Beat'n with the band
That was me
Yeah, that was me, sweating cobwebs under contract
In the cellar, on TV
That was me
The same me that stands here now
If fate agreed that all of this
To make a lifetime, who am I to disagree?
That was me
Yeah, that was me
That was me accapella at the altar
In the middle of the picture
That was me
That was me at the party, sweating cobwebs
In a cellar on TV
Yeah, that was me
The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life that's pretty hard to take it in
That was me
That was me
That was meTeacher said I had my head in the clouds
They directed, I suspected, disconnected
Hat in my way
On the street, I had my feet on the ground
Stood corrected, well protected, resurrected
Had it my way
I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as they're not around
But I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Yes, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Love is fab, it's like a stab in the heart
My hidden treasure, made to measure, for my pleasure
I had it my way
I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as they're not around
But I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Yes, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as they're not around
But I find it so hard I find it so hardLightning hits the house of wax
Poets spill out on the street
To set alight the incomplete
Remainders of the future
Hidden in the yard
Hidden in the yard
Thunder drowns the trumpets blast
Poets scatter through the night
But they can only dream of flight
Away from their confusion
Hidden in the yard
Underneath the wall
Buried deep below a thousand layers lay
The answer to it all
Lightning hits the house of wax
Women scream and run around
To dance upon the battleground
Like wild demented horses
Hidden in the yard
Underneath the wall
Buried deep below a thousand layers lay
The answer to it allAt the end of the end, it's the start of a journey
To a much better place
And this wasn't bad, so a much better place
Would have to be special
No need to be sad
On the day that I die, I'd like jokes to be told
And stories of old to be rolled out like carpets
That children have played on
And laid on while listening to stories of old
At the end of the end, it's the start of a journey
To a much better place
And a much better place would have to be special
No reason to cry
On the day that I die, I'd like bells to be rung
And songs that were sung to be hung out like blankets
That lovers have played on
And laid on while listening to songs that were sung
At the end of the end, it's the start of a journey
To a much better place
And a much better place would have to be special
No reason to cry
No need to be sad
At the end of the endIf you really love me baby, better then staying in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your head
If you really love me baby til you fall down dead, she said
If you ever want to make it, nod your head
Nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, round and round
Round and round
If you ever want to prove it, then you hang it on a thread
If you ever want to shake it, nod your head
If you think the life you're leading is better then the life you lead
If you like the life you're living, well, nod your head
Well nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, round and round
Round and round
Round and round
If you really love me baby, better then staying in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your headStaring from a cardboard castle down and out
One of life's young students finds out what it's all about
Paper flutters, angry taxi drivers shout
From the pages of a paper, candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine
They suggest a highly recommended wine
Once again the same old line
Why so sad, my fine young friend?
Why so blue?
Weary carriage horses stand in single file
Someone at a crowded bus stop wears a friendly smile
Touching nerves that no one's heard from in a while
Papers from the same old file
Why so sad, my fine young friend?
Why so blue?
Sometimes, when eyes meet, you know
They have to meet again
Sometimes birds of a feather
Got to fly together
From a dingy attic window candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine
Now they drink the highly recommended wine
Free at last and feeling fine
I'm so glad, my fine young friend
Glad for you
I'm so glad, my fine young friend
Glad for you
You used to be so blue, you used to be so blue
Why so blue?Look at that
Look at her walking
Turning my head
Taking my breath away
Come on to meMy brave, my brave
My brave face
I've been living in style
Unaccustomed as I am to the luxury life
I've been hitting the town and it didn't hit back
I've been doing the rounds
Unaccustomed as I am to the time on my hands
Now I don't have to tell anybody when I'm gonna get back
Ever since you went away, I've had
This sentimental inclination not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheet back on the bed
I want to go bury my head in your pillow
Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
Take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face
Where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face
My brave face
I've been living a lie, unaccustomed as I am
To the work of a housewife, I've been breaking up
Dirty dishes and been throwing them away
Ever since you left I have been trying to compose a
'Baby, will you please come home?' Note meant for you
As I clear away another untouched TV dinner
From the table I laid for two
Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
Take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face
Where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face
My brave faceI needed loving, I needed a friend
I needed something that would be there in the end
Of the rough ride to Heaven
Want to get inside; what will I do?
Oh, on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
I knew you'd help me, I knew you could
You knew I didn't want to be misunderstood
Of the rough ride to Heaven
Want to get inside; what will I do?
Oh, on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
I'm not asking for an easy passage
So I hope you understand
I'm not after any special treatment
But I wouldn't mind a hand
On a rough ride, on a rough ride
On a rough ride, on a rough ride
On a rough ride To Heaven
Want to get inside; what will I do?She makes me go so wrong
(Yeah you kept me awake you know you did)
I've loved her, oh, so long
(So why don't you come right out and say it, stupid?)
She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too
My intentions are quite sincere
(That's not what you said the other night)
And all you can do is sneer
(So go ahead and kid yourself, you're right)
She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too
I've got a better chance than you do
I know that you want her too
You're such a hopeless romantic
She told me you're so predictable and nice
She only did you a favor once or twice (once or)
Once or twice
She makes me go so wrong
(So why don't you lie back and enjoy it?)
My conscience is clear and strong
(Yes, she says I'm just the boy for it)
She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too
I know that you want her too
I know that you want her tooWhat is this thing in life that persuades me to spend
Time away from you?
If you can answer this, you can have the moon
This is the place to be, anyway you can see
There's a lovely view
Why are there always so many other things to do?
Distractions, like butterflies, are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free
From these distractions
The postman's at the door while the telephone rings
On the kitchen wall
Pretend we're not at home, and they'll disappear
I want to be with you, tell me what I can do
Nothing is too small
Away from all this jazz, we could do anything at all
Distractions, like butterflies, are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the things we'd do if we could only be through
With these distractions
I'll find the peaceful place far a way from the noise of a busy day
Where we can spend our nights counting shooting stars
Distractions, like butterflies, are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the things we'd do if we could only be through
With these distractions
Distractions, like butterflies, are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free
From these distractionsGoing fast, coming soon
We made love in the afternoon
Found a flat, after that
We got married
Working hard for the dream
Scoring goals for the other team
Times were bad, we were glad
We got married
I love the way you open up your hearts to each other
When you find a meeting of the minds
Just as well love was all we ever wanted
It was all we ever had
Further on in the game
Waiting up till the children came
Place your bets, no regrets
We got married, we got married, we got married
Nowadays every night flashes by
At the speed of light
Living life, loving wife
We got married
Ohh, I love the things that happen when we start to discover
Who we are and what we're living for
Just because love was all we ever wanted
It was all we ever had
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work out at itGive me your hand
I'd like to shake it
I want to show you I'm your friend
You'll understand
If I can make it clear
It's all that matters in the end
"Put it there if it weights a ton"
That's what a father says to his young son
"I don't care if it weights a ton
As long as you and I are here, put it there
Long as you and I are here, put it there"
If there's a fight, I'd like to fix it
I hate to see things go so wrong
The darkest night and all it's mixed emotions
Are getting lighter sing along
"Put it there if it weights a ton"
That's what a father says to his young son
"I don't care if it weights a ton
As long as you and I are here, put it there
Long as you and I are here, put it there"Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know
Why can't we travel a continuous line?
Make a love a reliable covenant all the time
Up and down the hills I go
I got to know
I got to know
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight
Well, figure it out for yourself, little girl
I don't go nowhere at all
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall
Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eightThis one, this one, this one
This one, this one...
Did I ever take you in my arms, look you in the eye
Tell you that I do?
Did I ever open up my heart
And let you look inside?
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black
Did I ever touch you on the cheek, say that you were mine
Thank you for the smile?
Did I ever knock upon your door
Try to get inside?
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black
What opportunities did we allow to flow by
Feeling like the timing wasn't quite right?
What kind of magic might have worked if we had stayed calm?
Couldn't I have given you a better life?
Did you ever take me in your arms, look me in the eye
Tell me that you do?
Did I ever open up my heart
Let you look inside?
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A God is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black
This one is gliding, oh
A God is riding, oh
How calm the water
How calm the water and bright the rainbowBurn the midnight lamp down until the dawn
I'll keep watch until I'm sure you're coming home
Shadows play and flicker on the bedroom wall
They turn into a bad dream overnight
Something could be terribly wrong
Don't be careless love
Don't be, don't be careless
In my dream you're running nowhere
Every step you've taken turns to glue
Walking down a spiral staircase
Failing through, failing through
Don't be careless love
Be careless love
The lamp burns down and out
I'm getting pretty tired of this
I feel so bad, something might be going amiss
I won't be there so look out for yourself
You're getting in deep whatever you do
Don't let me go back to sleep
Saw your face in the morning paper
Saw your body rolled up in a rug
Chopped up into two little pieces
By some thug
But in the morning light
When I wake up again
You're by my side and that's the way it's always been
But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you
Your mind plays funny tricks on you
Don't be careless loveI feel such sorrow
I feel such shame
I know I won't arrive on time
Before whatever out there is gone
What can I do, that day is done
It's just a promise, that I made
I said I'd walk in her parade
Hot scalding tears I thought would flow
Still in my heart they'll never show
That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is done
Well I recall, the time and place
When they announced her precious face
I thought at once my heart would burst
Still, every time is like the first
There was applause when she stepped up
I wished that I could interrupt
I made no sign, I made no sound
I know I must stay underground
That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is done
That's why she walks, or so they say
She always knew just what I needed
Now if she would, just look my way
One time before they proceed
She sprinkles flowers in the dirt
That's when a thrill becomes a hurt
I know I'll never see her face
She walks away from my resting place
That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is doneHow many people stand in a line?
How many people never get a chance to shine?
If you can tell me, I'll gladly listen
How many people have died?
One too many right now for me
I want to be happy, I want to be free
One too many right now for me
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully
How many people go for a ride?
How many people never make it through to the other side?
If you can tell me, I'll gladly listen
How many people have cried?
One too many right now for me
I want to be happy, I want to be free
One too many right now for me
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully
How many people will it take?
How many people for goodness sake?
How many people?
How many people?
One too manyI can't get over your love
No matter how hard life seems
There's a light in my dreams
Thanks to you
My friends keep asking me why
There's such a smile on my face
There's a home at my place
Thanks to you
I don't want anything from you
Turn on your motor of love
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of love
I can't get over your love
No matter how lost I feel
I know my love is real
Thanks to you
You simply reached out your hand
And touched me deep in my soul
I came in out of the cold
Thanks to you
I won't steal anything from you
You give me more than enough
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of love
There was a time
When I was down and counted out
Well I remember I felt so bad
I nearly threw away
Nearly threw away the keys
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of loveOù est le soleil?

Travaillez (travaillez)I'm flying to my home
The sun is fading in the west
Out where the cattle roam
I'm like a bird at the end of the day
Flying to my home
I'm flying to my home sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home
The sky is like a painted flag
Above a sea of chrome
I've got a woman living in my life
Living in my home
I'm flying to my home sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home
I haven't been back for so long
I don't know if I'm going to recognize it
They gave the old place a new face
And I'm going to take some time
To size the situation up
I haven't been back for so long
I don't know if I'm going to recognize it
They gave the old place a new face
And I'm going to take some time
To size the situation up
The sun is fading in the west
Out where the cattle roam
I've got a woman living in my life
Living in my home
I'm flying to my home sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home
I'm flying to my home sweet majesty
I'm flying to my homeHere lies the powder and perfume
The pretty clothes are scattered 'round the room
And it's so like Candy
Here lies the lipstick and the face
The colored tablets keep it all in place
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy
What did I do to make her go?
Why must she be the one that I have to love
So like Candy?
Here lies a picture of a girl
Her arms are tight around that lucky guy
And it's so like Candy
And in her eyes a certain look
I thought I'd seen the last of long ago
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy
What did I do to make her go?
Why must she be the one that I have to love
So like Candy?
I remember the day that picture was taken
We were so happy then, but that's so like Candy
She seemed so sweet to me I was mistaken
Oh no, not that again, but that's so like Candy
She just can't face the day
So she turns and melts away
Here lie the records that she scratched
And on the sleeve I find a note attached
And it's so like Candy
"My Darling Dear it's such a waste"
She couldn't say "goodbye", but "I admire your taste"
And it's so like Candy
So like CandyMy cousin Lil comes home at eight
That's late for her
Her husband Dan just doesn't show 'til she's in bed
That's when he dons his latest listening device
And hears the right nice music in his head
Return to Pepperland
Come back to love and peace, return today
Return to Pepperland
It's not a mile away
The children Bill and Kate live near
A year apart
While as for Gran she stays downstairs they're very kind
She thinks of ancient mysteries running through her life
And gets them all mixed up inside her mind, mmhmm
Return to Pepperland
Come back to love and peace, return today
Return to Pepperland
It's not a mile away

Play it forever (Return)
And ever (to Pepperland)
Uh-oh (It's not a mile away)
Dear old Dad
What are you writing now?
Twenty years later, who would have guessed?
Nelson Mandela still under arrest
People demanding
Love understanding
Why don't we do something now?
My cousin Min is
Never in, the big men say
"Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa

It's not a mile awayHey, you sinners, open all the doors
Have I got news for you
About that money loving preach of yours
Friday night you'll find him taking pictures
Of a model in a cheap hotel
Sunday morning he's raving from the pulpit
Threatening to send us all to hell, well, well
Don't throw, don't throw, don't throw
Don't throw any stones
If you can't live by what you teach
You better leave alone
Don't throw, don't throw, don't throw
Don't throw any stones
Unless you practice what you preach
You'll never find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Don't throw, don't throw, don't throw
Don't throw any stones
If you can't live by what you teach
You better leave alone
Don't throw, don't throw, don't throw
Don't throw any stones
Unless you practice what you preach
You'll never find love
Hey, you sinners, well, you never can tell
The glory train is leaving in the morning
But the preacher's there to say farewell, well, well
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Yet be you who is without sins, cast the first stone
(the first stone, the first stone, the first stone)
Can't find love
Can't find love
You can't find love
You can't find loveThat's a good, that's a good sign

Yeah, it's a...
I love the way that my heartbeat increases
When you walk in a room
The chemicals that my body releases
Dispel any feelings of gloom
That's a good sign, see the meter's moving
That's a good sign, let us keep improving
That's a good sign, see the meter's moving
That's a good sign; don't you know?
I love electrical shocks and surprises
Keep attacking my heart
I know the way my temperature rises
Had to be there from the start
That's a good sign, see the meter's moving
That's a good sign, let us keep improving
That's a good sign, see the meter's moving
That's a good sign; don't you know?

Right now
I love the way that my heart rate increases
When you walk in a room
The chemicals that my body releases
Dispel any feelings of gloom
That's a good, that's a good sign
That's a good, that's a good sign
That's a, that's a good
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't you, don't you know? (Ooh, ooh)
Don't you know? Don't you know? Ooh. Ooh, ooh
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good

That's a good sign, see the meter's moving, that's a good sign. Don't you know? Don't you know?
That's a good sign, see the meter's moving, that's a good sign, let us keep improvingWell, you said you loved me
But you know it was a lie
You said you loved me
But you know it was a lie
And that's the reason, but it's not the only reason
I wanna cry, cry, cry
You said you would find me
But you know you never came, yeah
You told me you would find me, pretty baby
But you know you never came, yeah
Well, the other night, you talked in your sleep, baby
You called out another man's name, yeah
You said you loved me
Oh, but you know it was a lie
You said you loved me
Whoa, but you know it was a lie
Ooh, that's the reason, but it's not the only reason
I wanna cry, cry, cryTo me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day
You can't take that away
No, you can't take that away
All my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way
That was up until today
Oh it had to be this way
Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission given
You seem to have a friendlier smile than all the rest
Well I looked and you were best
Yeah I've looked at all the rest
You can't imagine passionate words that I would say
If only you would stay
Oh you know you got to stay
Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission given
You used to be and early bird
But how was I to know you would leave without shedding a tear
I only want to love you
I'll make a wish and suddenly I'm glad that I have you here
Oh I'm glad I have you here
Today
To me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day
You can't take that away
No, you can't take that away
All my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way
That was up until today
Oh it had to be this way
Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission givenI got crows at my window, dogs at my door
I don't think I can take any more
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know
My brother told me, "life's not a pain"
But that was right when it started to rain
Where am I going wrong?
I don't know
But it's alright, sleep tight
I will take the strain
You're fine, love of mine
You will feel no pain
Well, I see trouble at every turn
I've got so many lessons to learn
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know
Now what's the matter with me?
Am I right? Am I wrong?
Now I started to see
I must try to be strong
I try to love you best as I can
But you know that I'm only a man
Why am I going wrong?
I don't know
Mmm, yeah, mmm
Oh, woah, woah, woah, mhmm
But it's alright, sleep tight
I will take the strain
Yeah, you're fine, little love of mine
You will feel no pain
I got crows at my window and dogs at my door
But I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know
Now what's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't knowI saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation
I swear I caught a look before you turned away
Now I don't see the point resisting your temptation
Did you come on to me?
Will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do
I don't think I can wait like I'm supposed to do
How soon can we arrange a formal introduction?
We need to find a place where we can be alone
To spend some special time without an interruption
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do, yeah
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do
Before you grab your coat, I'll try to be discreet
You know we can't be seen exchanging information
Well, I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, will I come on to you?
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now, uh-huh
If you, if you come on to me (yeah), then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you come on to me, then I'll come on to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll come on to you
Whoo!I sat around all day
I used to get stoned
I liked to get wasted
But these days I don‘t
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah
I walked around angry
I used to feel bad
But nowadays my days
Don‘t have to be sad
'Cause I'm happy, with you
I got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah
Like, hear the high clear robin sing
Walk a bluebell carpet
Watch the children playing games
Catch a moon and drop it
Hear the gentle mantle roll
On a frosty morning
See the mighty ocean break
Like a sailor's warning
I used to drink too much
Forgot to come home
I lied to my doctor
But these days I don't
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah
Throw a pocketful of coins in the Trevi fountain
See an ice cold running stream
Rushing down the mountain
Hear a new born baby lamb
Calling for its mother
Watching reunited friends
Loving one another
I sat around all day
I liked to get stoned
I used to get wasted
But these days I don‘t
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah
Mmm, happy with you
I'm happy with you
Happy with youA-one, a-two
Oh yeah
Did you ever get hurt by the words people say
And the things that they do when they're picking on you?
Did you ever get sad by the games that they play
When they're making you feel like a rusty old wheel?
It's been left in the rain
Who cares what the idiots say
Who cares what the idiots do
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
I do
'Cause you're worth much more
Of that you can be sure
No need to hide
The love you've got inside
Did you ever get lost in the heart of a crowd
And the people around keep on pushing you down? (Hmm)
Is it driving you mad, and you're screaming out loud
And you're wondering who's going to recognise you?
You're a ghost in the dark
Who cares what the idiots say
Who cares what the idiots do
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
Who cares what the idiots say
Who cares what the idiots do
Who knows about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
I do
You've been left in the rainCome on baby now, let me look at you
Talking 'bout yourself, try to tell the truth
I could stay up half the night, trying to crack your code
I could stay up half the night, but I'd rather hit the road
On the night that I met you, I was on the town
On the night that I met you
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you
Come on baby now, help me work it out
I won't let you down so you don't need to shout
I could stay up half the night, playing with your head
I could stay up half the night, but I'd rather go to bed
On the night that I met you, I was on the town
On the night that I met you
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you
And everyday, in every way
And everyday, in every way
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh youYou used to be my confidante
My underneath-the-staircase friend
But I fell out of love with you
And brought our romance to an end
I played with you throughout the day
And told you every secret thought
Unlike my other so-called friends
You stood beside me as I fought
In your reflected glory, I
Could dream of shining far off lands
Where serpents turn to bits of string
And played like kittens in my hand
In our imaginary world
Where butterflies wear army boots
And stomp around the forest
Chanting long lost anthems
Long lost anthems
You used to be my confidante
My underneath-the-staircase friend
But I fell out of love with you
And brought our romance to an end
I played with you throughout the day
And told you every secret thought
Unlike my other so-called friends
You stood beside me as I fought
You stood beside me as I fought
You used to be my confidanteLadies and gentlemen
I'm standing before you with something important to say
With some trepidation I crave your attention but
I'm not gonna let anything get in my way
The message is simple, it's straight from my heart
And I know that you've heard it before
But what does it matter, we're in it together
And I'm not quitting while people are crying for more
People want peace
People want peace
A simple release from their suffering
People want peace
People want peace
Nothing in life is as sad as the lonely soul
Searching for peace
Only to find disappointment is waiting
Behind every door that we open
Every catch, we release
A-brothers and sisters, I beg you to listen
I know that it isn't too late
For we as the people, the voices of freedom
And we're all perfectly clear that we don't wanna wait
People want peace
People want peace
A simple release from their suffering
People want peace
People want peace
People want peace
People want peace
Yes, we want peace!
People want peace (Yeah, yeah!)
People want peaceWanna give you my heart
Wanna tell you my story
Gonna take it to another level, you and me
Wanna give you my word
Let me give you my promise
I will try to make it happen, you can guarantee
Hand in hand
Walking through life
And making our plans
Hand in hand
Let me enter your light
Wanna show you my passion
We can make each other happy if we get it right
Hand in hand
Walking through life and making our plans
Hand in hand
Taking our time and making a stand
We can make this dream come true
Only if we wanted to
We can make this dream come true
Only when we understand
Everything in life is planned
Can we make this dream come true
Wanna give you my heart
Wanna tell you my story
Gonna to take it to another level, you and me
Hand in hand
Walking through life and making our plans
Hand in hand
Hand in handIn time we'll know, it's all a show
It's been a blast
As time goes by, we'll laugh and cry
It's in the past
We can start to begin
Living in the world we're in
From day to day, we'll fight and play
For what we need
We'll soon forget we ever met
And disagreed
We can start to begin (to begin)
Living in the world we're in (world we're in)
This is it (this is it), here and now (here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow
And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones are calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play
And soon we'll see that you and me
We're really friends
We broke the code and walked the road
That never ends
We can start to begin (to begin)
Living in the world we're in (world we're in)
This is it (this is it), here and now (here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow
And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, hey-hey
We'll take our turn and try to learn
To sing and dance
We'll hedge our bets with no regrets
And take a chance
We can start to begin (to begin)
Living in the world we're in (world we're in)
This is it (this is it), here and now (here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow
And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, yay-yay
In time we'll know, it's all a show
It's been a blastBack in Brazil
There lives a girl
Dreams of the future
And a far, far better world
Back in Brazil
She meets a man
He's tall and handsome
And he fits in with her plan
Bright lights ahead
Music and fun
Nights are for dancing
And the days are for the sun
All kinds of weather
Will surely come and go
But they're together
And together they will steal the show
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ban!
Back in Brazil
She makes a date
He has to cancel
'Cause they got him working late
Back in Brazil
She feels afraid
Hope starts to crumble
And her dreams begin to fade
Her lights are out
She's gone to bed
Nights are for sleeping
If a girl's to get ahead
Even the weather
Has started changing too
But they'll be together
And together they will make it through
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban!
So we raise a family
As the clouds roll by
Making pictures of us in the sky
The kids are happy
And they don't ask why
Ba-de-da-de-da, you and IGot the time, the inclination
I have answered your invitation
I'll be leaving in the morning
Watch me go
I don't know where the wind is blowing
Got directions to where I'm going
Nothing's certain
That's the only thing I know
Do it now, do it now while the vision is clear
Do it now while the feeling is here
If you leave it too late, it could all disappear
Do it now while your vision is clear
Do-do-doo, do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-do
Do-do-doo-ooh, doo-ooh
I don't regret the steps I'm taking
The decision that I'm making
Is the right one
Or I'm never going to know
Got the time, the inclination (It's not too late, late, late)
I have answered your invitation (You've still got time, time, time)
I'll be leaving in the morning (Follow the beat of)
Watch me go (Your heart, heart, heart)
Do it now, do it now while your vision is clear
Do it now while the feeling is here
If you leave it too late, it could all disappear
Do it now while your vision is clear
Do-do-doo, do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-doo, do-do-dooShe's a rock
She's a rock
She's a rock
If I could find the words to talk about my woman
Well, I would surely shout them out
But every time I feel my inspiration coming
It’s all too much to talk about
'Cause she breaks me up, she takes me down
She sends my sideways
She's with me every way I turn
If I'm back to school
She gotta be my favourite teacher
There’s such a lot for me to learn
'Cause she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)
Somehow she always knows exactly what is needed
When I’ve been running 'round and 'round
And if she wants me, but I know that I’ve succeeded
I’ll be heading back to town
'Cause she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)
Caesar rock, he's a rock
He's a rock, he's a rock
She's a rock
(Hey) She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
Yeah, now she's a rock (She's a rock)
Woo-hoo-hoo
She's got loyalty like the royalty
She's got symmetry, anonymity
She's got all the looks
She got all the books
She got matching teeth
She got matching teeth!Part I
Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
The captain won't be listening
To what's being said
He feels that there's a good chance
That we have been misled
And so the captain's planning
To steam ahead
What can we do, what can we do
What can we do to stop this foolish plan going through?
What can we do, what can we do? (Yeah, yeah!)
This man is bound to lose his ship and his crew
Despite repeated warnings
From those who ought to know
Well, he's got his own agenda
And so he'll go
(What can we do?)
Those who shout the loudest (What can we do?)
May not always be the smartest (What can we do?)
But they have their proudest moments
Right before they fall
(What can we do?)
Red sky in the morning (What can we do?)
Doesn't ever seem to faze him (What can we do?)
But a sailor's warning signal
Should concern us all, whoa-oh
Part II
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day
The engineer lives with his wife and daughter, Janet
But he misses them so
Although he's working with the best crew on the planet (We're the best crew on the planet!)
They never want him to go
He had a premonition
He senses something's wrong
And by his own admission
He knew it all along
The captain's crazy
But he doesn't let them know it
He'll take us with him
If we don't do something soon to slow it
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day
Below decks, the engineer cries
The captain's gonna leave us when the temperatures rise
The needle's going up, the engine's gonna blow
And we are gonna be left down below
Down below
Part III
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes we can do it
Yes, we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes, we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes, we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Oh yeah
If life would work out the way you plan it
That'd be so fine for the wife and Janet
Sometimes you might have to battle through it
And that's the way you learn how you've got to do it
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa
Yes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa
Part I reprise
Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
Well, the captain wasn't listening
To what was said
So we went to the captain (What can we do? / For those who shout the loudest)
And we told him to turn around (What can we do? / May not always be the smartest)
But he laughs in our faces (What can we do? / But they have their proudest moments)
Says that we are mistaken (Right before they fall)
So we gather around him (What can we do? / Red sky in the morning)
Now the ropes that have bound him (What can we do? / Doesn't ever seem to faze him)
Prove that he should have listened (What can we do? / But a sailor's warning signal) (Should concern us all)
To the will of the people
It's the will of the people
It's the will of the peopleI can't find my love
No matter how hard I try
She's giving me the runaround
And makes me wanna lay down and cry
Come on back to me right now
'Cause you don't have to stay away
I won't play no hide-and-seek
It's not a game I wanna play
Travelling around the world
Trying to find a perfect mate
I found myself a little girl
But now she's started running away
Come on back to me right now
Don't wait 'til they unleash the hounds
If you don't get back today
They'll follow your trail and hunt you down
I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a basket, but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked since I was born
Born to follow you wherever you go
But my problem is I never do know
Where you're taking me, I don't have a clue
I've been naked since I was born
Save my soul and set it free
Free to fly home
There's a place I'm meant to be
Back, back home
I've been broken in so many places
Put together by a sea of faces
What to make of them
I don't hardly know
I've been naked for so long, so long
I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a basket, but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked for so long
I've been naked for so long
So long, so long, now
So let's get started
I’m ready to be heard
Before the dear departed
Can have the final word
In a perfect situation
I'd have told you long ago
But now I think it's time
You ought to know
So let me tell you
Right here and now
I’m gonna love you
And I will tell you how
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my word
And we'll get started now
You're not expected
To stand on hallowed ground
But know you'll be protected
As long as I'm around
To ensure there's no confusion
I would like to make it clear
If you need my help
I promise I’ll be here
So let me tell you
Right here and now
I’m gonna love you
And I will tell you how
I'll give you my heart
I’ll give you my word
And we'll get started now
Get started
Let's get started, now
Get started, started, yeah
Get started now, yeah, yeah
Get started, yeah
Oh, let's get started, yeah
Get start, don’t, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't start it now
Yeah, get startedOkay, okay, okay
I wonder why you're coming to me
I think you must want something for free
I try to work out what I could say
But my brain's not working today
I know you need something
You're talking to me
You're talking to me
I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?
I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free
Okay, okay, okay (Nothing's for free)
You've got a real cool way about you
Is there a lot you want me to do? (Yeah)
I'd love to help out in any way
But my brain stopped working today
I know you need something
You're talking to me
You're talking to me
I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?
I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free
I want to tell you what it means to me
I love you every way and now, and now
But I can't make up my mi-mi-mind
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wonder why you're coming to me
I think you must want something for free
I'd love to help out in any way
But-but my brain stopped working today
I know you need something
You're talking to me
You're talking to me
I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?
I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free
Okay, okay, okay
My brain stopped working
My brain stopped working
My brain stopped working todayThere was a time when we walked by the docks
And I told you, "I need you all of my life"
And watching the tugs rolling by together
Do you remember?
Do you remember the lights on the shore?
How they reflected the rain on the road?
I believed that you love me alone
It was real, do you remember?
Now and then I see your face
I've been wanting a lovin’ embrace
I've been looking for love, but it gets me nowhere
Oh, yeah, yeah (Uh)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love, uh)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
I can't get enough of, of you
It was a time we were all full of hope
Saw the future burning bright
As we watched the moon rollin’ out to sea
Do you remember?
But those days are erased from my mind
Yeah, I've left all those old days behind
But still I remember your face forever, forever
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love, uh)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
I can't get enough of, of you
Ooh
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
I think maybe I should, go back to nature, traditional
And reexamine the art that you've ever seen, tried and traditional
I think it's time we all go together
We all want more
Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
I can't get enough, enough of youWe had the greatest time
At Frank Sinatra's party
We drank expensive wine
Then watched the night roll by
I saw a showgirl dance
With Sammy Davis Jr
They had a brief romance
Under the desert sky
Fee, fi, fo, fum
I’m not the only Englishman
I'm under cover, but plenty of others
Are already flying high
See Angie Dickinson
Bump into Peter Lawford
She's out to have some fun
He doesn’t seem to mind
You don't have to doubt yourself
No, not on a night like this
Jump in the swimming pool
Say hi to Dino Martin
He's hot to play it cool
Watching the girls go by
Fee, fi, fo, fum
I'm not the only Englishman
I'm under cover, but some of my brothers
Are already flying high
Come and enjoy yourself

(That's right, hey)
Beware my love, well he'll bowl you over
Beware my love, before you're much older
Hey, he'll sweep you up under his carpet
You'd be in luck if you could stop it
Come on now
Beware my love
(Lemme tell her)
Well, he'll wear you out, and in a minute
You'll hear a shout, and then you'll be in it
So, so now beware my love, 'cause he'll take you under
Beware, my love, the sound of his thunder
Yeah!
I don't believe that he's the one
But if you insist, I must be wrong
I must be wrong
But I have to leave, and when I'm gone
I'll leave my message in my song
That's where I'm gonna leave it, baby
Come on
Beware, my love, don't you know he'll bowl you over?
Beware, my love before you're much older
He's gonna, yeah, he's gonna wear you out

And then you'll be in it
Baby gonna be there
Ow, beware
Yeah I'll be there
Oh, baby, beware
Beware, beware, my love
Yeah, any minute, oh

'Cause I'm just gonna say to you my love
That you better be there
Can't say, I've found out
I'll tell you to
Beware my love

Beware my loveDoctor Tom is getting on
All he does is sign his name
I get things my brainbox sings

But I'll go down again

I need to know, 'cause here I go again

I'm runnin' from the law, or they'll put me inside
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide?
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide?
I've been on the run since the good Lord knows when
And the day I die, I'll still be running then
Runnin' from the days when I would lay me down and cry
Baby, won't you let me have a little time to hide?

All day long I've been alone
And I must do something about it
Yes I must do something about it
Played another losing card game with myself
Lonely joker on a shelf
And I must do something about it
Yes I must do something about it
No one on the party line
No one seems to need a dime
No one even knows that I'm feeling this way
No one seems to need my vote
No one has to change a note
No one here to hold my coat
Oh, what a day
I've just watched another movie on t.v
No one's in the house but me
And I must do something about it
Yes I must do something about it
Oh, oh, something about it

All day long I've been alone
And I must do something about it

And from what you've got
I'd say you're doing well, dear
Dressed like a dream
And if things are what they seem
You're looking swell, dear
Your little man
Brings you trinkets when he can
But he can't stay, dear
That's very well
But inside your shiny shell
You dance all day, dear
So go, Begay
Let your feelings leap away
Into the laughter

When your world is touched by sadness

Tells the story of our love
Moonlight on the water
Brings me inspiration ever after

(Say, say, say)I know I was a crazy fool
For treating you the way I did
But something took a hold of me
And I acted like a dustbin lid
I didn't give a second thought
To what the consequence might be
I really wouldn't be surprised
If you were trying to find another me
'Cause the other me would rather be the glad one
The other me would rather play the fool
I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a rule
I know it doesn't take a lot
To have a little self-control
But every time that I forgot
Well I landed in another hole
But everytime you pull me out
I find it harder not to see
That we can build a better life
If I can try to find the other me
The other me would rather be the glad one
Yeah, the other me would rather play the fool
Said I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a rule
But if I ever hurt you
Well you know that it's not real
It's not easy living by yourself
So imagine how I feel
I wish that I could take it back
I'd like to make a different mood
And if you let me try again
I'll have a better attitude
Well I know that one and one makes two
And that's what I want us to be
I really would appreciate it
If you'd help me find the other me
The other me would rather be the glad one
The other me would rather play the fool
But I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a ruleLove, I'm going to pick you up in the morning
Love, I'm going to take you out on a journey
I don't know where I'm going to
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side
What good is butter if you haven't got bread?
What good is art when it hurts your head?
Might as well be in bed
Keep under cover till the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble till the prisoners are released
What good's a puzzle when you haven't a clue?
What good is me when I'm not with you?
Might as well stay in bed
Keep under cover till the clouds disappear
Keep out of trouble till the weather is bright and clear
Love, I'm going to pick you up
I'm going to take you out
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side
Without you by my side
What good is tennis when there isn't a ball?
What good's a curtain without a call?
Might as well be in bed
Keep under cover till the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble till the prisoners are released
Love, I'm going to pick you up
I'm going to take you out
I don't know what I'm going to do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side

Who knows what a mystery may bring
Once in a life I'm a lucky man
If I can find the kind of love
That's going to last for me
Twice in a lifetime

I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine
It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soul
Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to know which way to turn
Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
How much it cost or what it's worth
Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were
We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels
Some days I cry
I cry for those who live in fear
Some days I don't
I don't remember why I'm here
No use reminding me, it's just the way it is
Who ran the race or came in first
Some days I cry
I cry for those who fear the worst
We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels
Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine
It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal?
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soulHe's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him find love
He's got to do it for himself, and it can take so long
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
He doesn't need another helping hand from someone
But don't you think he doesn't understand what he wants - someone
Though independence means a lot, he's got to still be strong
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
Find love, a perfect combination
Find love, whatever you do
Find love, a cause for celebration
Then it might come looking (looking)
Come looking for you
Find love, in any situation
Find love, whatever you do
Find love, a cause for celebration
And it might come looking (looking)
Come looking for you
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him to find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
Find love, a time for meditation
Find love, a source of inspiration
Find love, instead of confrontation
Find love, and love will come looking for youIt was written that I would love you
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the morning when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies
I will hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the inner most secrets we hide
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
Long live all of us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll love you for the rest of my
For the rest of my lifeMaking love underneath the bed
Shooting stars from a purple sky
I don't care how I do it
I'm the man on the flaming pie
I stick my tongue out and lick my nose
Tuck my shirt in and zip my fly
Go ahead, have a vision
I'm the man on the flaming pie
Everything I do has a simple explanation
When I'm with you, you could do with a vacation
I took my brains out and stretched them on the rack
Now I'm not so sure I'm ever going to get them back
Cut my toes off to spite my feet
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
Never mind, check my rhythm
I'm the man on the flaming pie
I'm the man on the flaming pie
Now, everything I do has a simple explanation (explanation)
When I'm with you, you could do with a vacation (vacation)
I took my brains out and stretched them on the rack
Now I'm not so sure I'm ever going to get them back
Ow!
Yeah!
Uh-huh!
Yeah! Ha-ha!Peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday
Wishful, not thinking what to do
We've been calling it love
But it's a dream we're going through
And if I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
Restful, like Devon on a Monday
Cooling my fingers in the bay
We've been learning a song
But it's a long and lonely blues
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
It's peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday
Wishful, not thinking what to do
We've been calling it love (love)
But it's a dream (dream) we're going through (through)
And if I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
(Yours would be, yours would be...)

Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why
You and me together, nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded, wondering why
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Some boat's on the ocean, we're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why
Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
So let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

As long as we're together, it's gonna be just fine cause I heard it on the wind
Howling through the middle of the mind

A little dash of magic, a little splash of light
Put it in your camera and it's gonna turn out alright
As long as were together, it's gonna be just fine, yeah, all the time, yeah
You know I heard it on the broomstick, howling through the middle of the mind
While I was on my broomstick. Well, I heard it on the wind
Howling in the middle of the night

I know it isn’t something I dreamed about
It's real, so real
When she looks into his eyes, I feel
Love come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
And it isn't gonna stop ’til I get to the bottom of this whole affair
I saw the look she gave
They must think I just got to town
It's one of those things you don't wanna talk about
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
So let's forget it 'til I can make it on my own
Although it won't be something to brag about
It's real, so real
When she looks into his eyes, I feel
Love come tumbling down

Waited for so long?
Though it may not be as good as new
Well, still, it must be better than the pain that I went through

Man: Well, we were after, um, a man who was, um, apparently have been doing something pretty desperate. We were anxious to, to get on his track, and there were six of us all together when we started off. Uh, we were 2 days on his trail, then we lost him...Say you don't love him, my salamander
Why do you need him?
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart
Keeping ahead of the rain on the road
Watching my windscreen wipers (wipers)

Cattle beware of snipers (snipers)
Oh, oh
When will you see me, my salamander?
Don't try to tell me
Oh no, don't answer, oh no

Off to the flicks with the piddle in her nicks
To the fair with her hair in curlers
Their cousins didn't get all down to the pleasure dome
Their cousins didn't spend their night in an aircraft hanger

You don't want to be the little woman I love
You're up all night, and we can let it hang out right (Yeah!)
I said good-bye to all my expectations
The day you walked out of my life
Winter time is a-coming now
Give me a sign if you can somehow
Make it clear where you're heading for
Will I see you someday at my door?
Taking it all into consideration
Love's a game I never win
I've been in very similar situations
Again and again and again
Oh, no, you don't want to be the little woman
You don't want to be the little woman I love
I love
Now you don't want to stay in my home
You just want be on your own
Well you don't want to be the little woman I love
Take it away!
Go down right
Well, things were fine all the summer long
And then things changed, so where did we go wrong?
We can run, but we cannot hide
In greener grass on the other side
Taking it all into consideration

In an effort to find a man, sir
She found herself in the old UK
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe
She scouted 'round in Scarborough
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe
She scouted 'round in Scarborough
In a village in old East End, sir
She met a fellow who made her real
Took her rushes to show, this man, sir
Met his dad at the wedding meal
In a letter from Old Siam, sir
Came a terrible tale of woe
She decided the only answer
Was to get off a pile of dough
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe
She scouted 'round in Scarborough
She waited 'round in Walthamstowe
She scouted 'round in Scarborough

He directed her not to stay

You couldn't have done a worse thing to me
If you'd have taken an arrow
And run it right through me, ooh
Ooh baby, a bird in the hand
Is worth two flying
But when it came to love
I knew you'd be lying
It could have been a finer fling
Would have been a major attraction
With no other thing
Offering a note of distraction
Come on, get up, get under way
And bring your love
Ooh baby
You wouldn't have found a more down hero
If you'd have started at nothing
And counted to zero
Ooh baby
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me
If you'd have taken an arrow
And run it right through me
It could have been a finer fling
Flying in a righter direction
With no other thing
Featuring but love and affection
Come on, get up, get under way
And bring your love
Ooh baby
You wouldn't have found a more down hero
If you'd have started at nothing
And counted to zeroWhy haven’t I had any dinner?
No no no
Why haven’t I had any dinner?
No no no
Whoa whoa whoa no no no no no no noWell, if the same thing happened to you
Would you still put me through what you put me through?
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
What if it happened that a man kept shaking you down
But you can't get a ride to his side of town?
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
What if it happened to you?
Keep it out of my shoes, and if you're stepping on toes
Keep it out of my nose
Because if the same thing happened to me
Well, it won't be as bad as it used to be

Well, what if it happened to you?After the Ball
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me
After the ball
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me
After the ball
Well, I arrived, looked around, but the room was full of strangers
Nowhere was a friendly face to be found
Later on, I awoke, but the party it was over
There you were waiting to bring me around
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me

Million Miles
How many million miles, Deo?
How many million miles, Deo?
When I get up, up, up in the morning
Whoa! Lord, I know
When I look up, up, up in the evening
Whoa! Lord, I know
How many million miles, Deo?
How many million miles, Deo?
How many million miles, Deo?Winter Rose
All through the summer, I have followed you around
Bringing a rose for the winter that's coming
Now the snow is on the ground
Winter rose, winter rose
Shine your light in the air
Winter rose, winter rose
Shine your light everywhere
Love Awake
Love awake, toll the bell
Tell the world how glad you are
Love awake to the day
When we can make our love awake
Lord knows we need it any time we can get it
But we forget it every now and then
But if you don't feel it, later on you'll regret it
And if we let it we could set it free, you and me
Love awake, toll the bell
Tell the world how glad you are
Love awake to the day
When we can make our love awake
Snow falls in the winter
Spring brings the rain
But it's never to long before the summer comes again
It always comes again!
Love awakeWe've got a chance and we'll take it
We may win or we may lose
We may even have to cut and run for it
Well, it won't be the first time I've run
And it won't be the first time I've been caught
It's the game that matters
Brother, I am proud to know you
This is one of the greatest moments I have ever experienced
I think I sense the situation when we I say that all esteem it an honour
To breathe the rather inferior atmosphere of this station
Here along with our little friend
I guess we should all go home and treasure the memory of his face
As the whitest thing in our museum of recollections
And, perhaps, this good woman will also go home
And wash the face of our little brother here
I'm inspired with a new faith in mankind
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to present to you
A sure enough saint, only once a halo to be transferred
Stand right upSomeone's got a home tonight
Someone's got a road tonight
Someone's got a wed, action will be red
Why'd you want to worry?
Oh, you're gonna knock them dead again
Well someone's got a show tonight
Someone's got to go tonight
Someone's doing rhyme, someone turn your mind
Someone lift your eyes up
Leaning towards the light
Woo hoo
So glad to see you here, so glad you could come (Yeah!)
So glad to see you here
Carry on, carry on
Yeah, yeah!
Oh, we're going up tonight
Well in time to make a flight
The airplane's standing on the runway
Engine nervously waiting for something to bite
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Got to roll tonight
You got to roll tonight
Some have got it bad, some have got to do it
You got it better, and there's nothing to it
No no no no
So glad to see you here, so glad you could come (Yeah!)
So glad to see you here
Carry on, carry on
Ah we opened up tonight
Someone's got to hold the light
Someone's got a wed, action will be red
Why'd you want to worry?
Oh you gonna knock 'em dead yeah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Whoa
We're open tonight for fun

We're open tonight for funWhen the moon lays his head on a pillow
And the stars settle down for a rest
Just do me one small favor, I beg you
Please play me my baby's request
It's the song that we heard when we started
Now the birds have all flown from our nest
But you could bring back memories departed
By playing my baby's request
My baby said that she knows how it goes
But you're the one that really knows
So go ahead, just one more time and then we'll go to bed
But you could bring back memories departed
By playing my baby's request
My baby said that she knows how it goes
But you're the one that really knows
So go ahead, just one more time and then we'll go to bed
When the moon lays his head on a pillow
And the stars settle down for a rest
Just do me one small favor, I beg you
Please play me baby's request
Mm-hmm, play me baby's request
Please play me my baby's request
One more timeEmotional moments, you left in a rage
But if you could love me now, I wouldn't be in a cage
Provisional license, I'm under arrest
But if you could get me out, I'd like to take another test
I've been said to tell you
That the man you were with last night
Is feeling sorry, sorry
But he told me to tell you
That he hardly ever lies
But he lied to you last night
He didn't mean it, no
Said he didn't mean it, no
He didn't mean it, no
Said he didn't mean it, no
I've been said to tell you
That the man you were with last night
Is feeling lonely only for you
He told me to tell you
That he hardly ever cries
But he cried for you last night, ooh
He didn't mean it, no
Said he didn't mean it, no
He didn't mean it, no
Said he didn't mean it, no
Emotional moment, you left in a rage
But if you could love me now, I wouldn't be in a cage
Dramatic performance direct from the stage
But if you could get me out, I wouldn't be in a cageWhat does she get for all the love she gave you
There on the ladder of regret?
Mighty river, give her all she gets
What does she get for all the love she gave you
There on the ladder of regret?
Daytime nighttime suffering is all she gets
Where are the prizes for the games she entered
With little chance of much success?
Daytime nighttime suffering is all she gets
Come on, river, overflow
Let your love for your people show
Come on, river, flow through me
Let your love for your people be
You are the river, I am the stream
Flow mighty river through me
What does it pay to play the leading lady
When like the damsel in distress
Daytime nighttime suffering is all she gets?
No less (no less), no more (no more)
No sea (no sea), no shore (no shore)
No sand (no sand), no pail (no pail)
No fairy tale anymore
Come on, river, flow through me
Don't be stopped by insanity
Come on, river, overflow
Let your love for your neighbours grow
You are the river, I am the stream
Flow mighty river through me
Daytime, nighttime suffering is all she gets
Daytime, nighttime suffering is all she gets, woah oh
Daytime, nighttime, nighttime suffering is all she gets
What does she get for all the love she gave you?Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, oooh

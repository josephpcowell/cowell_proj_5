When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleepingShe said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
I said, "who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "you don't understand what I've said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"

And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me

Doctor RobertTurn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginningAsked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star

Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all?
Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
He's a real nowhere man

Have you heard the word is love?

It's the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine

Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine

All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
She's the kind of girl who puts you down (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When friends are there, you feel a fool (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
(Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When you say she's looking good (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She acts as if it's understood (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
Girl
Girl, girl
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
Ah, girl
Girl, girlThere are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life, I love you moreIt's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
I feel as though you ought to know

We'll forget the tears we've cried
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

(Oh, yesterday)This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no replyI'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to beOh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with meMr. Moonlight

People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does

I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know
I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her
Though I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
AhhFor the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the billGood morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good...
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club BandI read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today—oh, boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

He's the all American, bullet-headed, Saxon mother's son
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"

You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all rightCry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Can you take me back where I came from
Can you take me back
Can you take me back where I came from
Brother, can you take me back
Can you take me back
Mm, can you take me where I came from
Can you take me backWoman is the nigger of the world
Yes she is, think about it
Woman is the  nigger of the world
Think about it, do something about it
We make her paint her face and dance
If she won't be a slave, we say that she don't love us
If she's real, we say she's trying to be a man
While putting her down, we pretend that she's above us
Woman is the  nigger of the world
Yes, she is
If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with
Woman is the slave of the slaves
Ah, yeah, better scream about it
We make her bear and raise our children
And then we leave her flat for being a fat old mother hen
We tell her home is the only place she should be
Then we complain that she's too unworldly to be our friend
Oh, woman is the  nigger of the world
Yes she is
If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with
Woman is the slave to the slaves
Yeah, alright, hit it!
We insult her every day on TV
And wonder why she has no guts or confidence
When she's young, we kill her will to be free
While telling her not to be so smart, we put her down for being so dumb
Well, woman is the  nigger of the world
Yes, she is
If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with
Woman is the slave to the slaves
Yes, she is
If you believe me, better scream about it
We make her paint her face and dance
We make her paint her face and dance
We make her paint her face and dance
We make her paint her face and dance
We make her paint her face and dance
We make her paint her face and danceWe lost our green land
We lost our clean air
We lost our true wisdom
And we live in despair
Oh sisters, oh sisters, lets stand up right now
It's never too late to start from the start
Oh wisdom, oh wisdom, that's what we ask for
And yes, my dear sisters, we must learn to ask
Wisdom, oh wisdom, that's what we ask for
That's what we live for now
Oh wisdom, oh wisdom, that's what we ask for
That's what we live for now
Oh sisters, oh sisters, let's wake up right on
It's never too late to shout from our hearts
Oh freedom, oh freedom that's what we fight for
And yes my dear sisters, we must learn to fight
Oh freedom, oh freedom, that's what we ask for
That's what we live for now
Oh freedom, oh freedom, that's what we ask for
That's what we live for now
Oh sisters, oh sisters, let's give up no more
It's never too late to build a new world
Oh new world, oh new world
That's what we live for
And yes, my dear sisters, we must learn to live
New world, oh new world, that's what we live for
That's what we all must all learn to build
Oh new world, oh new world, that's what we live for
That's what we must now learn to build
New world, oh new world, that's what we live for
That's what we must now learn to be
Oh new world, oh new world, that's what we live for
That's what we all must learn to beWhat a waste of human power
What a waste of human lives
Shoot the prisoners in the towers
Forty-three poor widowed wives
Attica State, Attica State, we're all mates with Attica State
Media blames it on the prisoners
But the prisoners did not kill
"Rockefeller pulled the trigger"
That is what the people feel
Attica State, Attica State, we're all mates with Attica State
Free the prisoners, jail the judges
Free all the prisoners everywhere
All they want is truth and justice
All they need is love and care
Attica State, Attica State, we're all mates with Attica State
They all live in suffocation
Let's not watch them die in sorrow
Now's the time for revolution
Give them all a chance to grow
Attica State, Attica State, we're all mates with Attica State
Come together, join the movement
Take a stand for human rights
Fear and hatred clouds our judgement
Free us all from endless night
Attica State, Attica State
We are all mates with Attica State
Attica State, Attica State
We all live in Attica State
Attica State, Attica State
Attica, Attica, Attica StateWe are born in a prison
Raised in a prison
Sent to a prison called school
We cry in a prison
We love in a prison
We dream in a prison like fools
Wood becomes a flute when it's loved
Reach for yourself and your battered mates
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate
We live with no reason
Kicked around for no reason
Thrown out without reason like tools
We work in a prison
And hate in a prison
And die in a prison as a rule
Wood becomes a flute when it's loved
Reach for yourself and your battered mates
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate
We live in a prison
Among judges and wardens
And wait for no reason for you
We laugh in a prison
Go through all four seasons
And die with no vision of truth
Wood becomes a flute when it's loved
Reach for yourself and for your battered mates
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate
Born in a prisonStanding on the corner, just me and Yoko Ono
We was waiting for Jerry to land
Up come a man with a guitar in his hand
Singing "have a marijuana if you can"
His name was David Peel, we found that he was real
He sang "The Pope Smokes Dope Everyday"
Up come a police man shoved us up the street
Singin, "Power to the People today!"
New York City...New York City...New York City
Que pasa New York?...Que pasa New York?
Hey hey
Well down to Max's City
Put down the nitty gritty with the Elephants Memory Band
Laid something down as the news spread around
About the Plastic Ono Elephants Memory Band!
We played some funky boogie and laid some "Tutti Frutti"
Singing "Long Tall Sally's A man"
Up come a preacher man trying to be a teacher
Singing "God's a red herring in drag!"
New York City...New York City...New York City
Que pasa New York?...Que pasa New York?
Hey hey
Hey, New York City
All right, New York City
New York City
Que pasa New York?...Que pasa New York?
Hey hey
Well we did the Staten Island Ferry
Making movies for the telly
Played the Fillmore and Apollo for freedom
Tried to shake our image
Just a cycling through the Village
But found that we had left it back in London
Well nobody came to bug us, hustle us or shove us
We decided to make it our home
If the man wants to shove us out
We gonna jump and shout
The Statue of Liberty said "Come!"
New York City...New York City...New York City
Que pasa New York?...Que pasa New York?
Hey hey
Hey New York City
Back in New York City
Hey New York City
Que pasa New York?...Que pasa New York?

Hey walk on
Yeah
Que pasa New York?...Que pasa New York?
Hey what a bad, bad city
Bad-ass city
Bad-ass city
Que pasa New York?...Que pasa New York?
Hey New York CityWell it was Sunday Bloody Sunday
When they shot the people there
The cries of thirteen martyrs
Filled the free Derry air
Is there any one amongst you
Dare to blame it on the kids?
Not a soldier boy was bleeding
When they nailed the coffin lids!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
You claim to be majority
Well you know that it's a lie
You're really a minority
On this sweet Emerald Isle
When Stormont bans our marchers
They've got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer
It's those mothers' turn to burn!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
You Anglo pigs and Scotties
Sent to colonise the north
You wave your bloody Union Jacks
And you know what it's worth!
How dare you hold to ransom
A people proud and free
Keep Ireland for the Irish
Put the English back to sea!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Well it's always bloody Sunday
In the concentration camps
Keep Falls and roads free forever
From the bloody English hands
Repatriate to Britain
All of you who call it home
Leave Ireland to the Irish
Not for London or for Rome!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!If you had the luck of the Irish
You'd be sorry and wish you were dead
You should have the luck of the Irish
And you'd wish you was English instead!
A thousand years of torture and hunger
Drove the people away from their land
A land full of beauty and wonder
Was raped by the British brigands! Goddamn! Goddamn!
If you could keep voices like flowers
There'd be shamrock all over the world
If you could drink dreams like Irish streams
Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn
In the 'Pool they told us the story
How the English divided the land
Of the pain and the death and the glory
And the poets of auld Eireland
If we could make chains with the morning dew
The world would be like Galway Bay
Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns
The world would be one big Blarney stone
Why the hell are the English there anyway?
As they kill with God on their side
Blame it all on the kids the IRA
As the bastards commit genocide! Aye! Genocide!
If you had the luck of the Irish
You'd be sorry and wish you were dead
You should have the luck of the Irish
And you'd wish you was English instead!
Yes you'd wish you was English instead!It ain't fair, John Sinclair
In the stir for breathing air
Won't you care for John Sinclair
In the stir for breathing air
Let him be
Set him free
Let him be like you and me
They gave him ten for two
And what else can the judges do
You got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
Got to set him free
If he had been a soldier man
Shooting gooks in Vietnam
If he was the CIA
Selling dope and making hay
He'd be free
They'd let him be
Breathing air like you and me
Right on
They gave him ten for two
What else can the judges do
You got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
Got to set him free
Free
They gave him ten for two
They got ole Leotis too
They got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
Got to set him free
Was he jailed for what he'd done
Representing everyone
Free John now if we can
From the clutches of the man
Let him be
Lift the lid
Bring him to his wife and kids
Alright
They gave him ten for two
What more can the bastards do
You got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
Got to set him freeAngela, they put you in prison
Angela, they shot down your man
Angela, you're one of the millions
Of political prisoners in the world
Sister, there's the wind that never dies
Sister, we're breathing together
Sister, our loves and hopes forever keep
On moving oh so slowly in the world
They gave you sunshine
They gave you sea
They gave you everything but the jailhouse key
They gave you coffee
They gave you tea
They gave you everything but equality
Angela, can you hear the earth is turning?
Angela, the world watches you
Angela, you soon will be returning
To your sisters and brothers in the world
Sister, you're still a people teacher
Sister, your word reaches far
Sister, there's a million different races
But we all share the same future in the world
They gave you sunshine
They gave you sea
They gave you everything but the jailhouse key
Hey they gave you coffee
They gave you tea
They gave you everything but equality
Angela, they put you in prison
Angela, they shot down your man
Angela, you're one of the millions
Of political prisoners in the worldThere may be not much difference
Between Chairman Mao and Richard Nixon
We strip them naked
There may be not much difference
Between Marilyn Monroe and Lenny Bruce
We check their coffins
There may be not much difference
Between White House and Hall of People
We count their windows
There may be not much difference
Between Raquel Welch and Jerry Rubin
We hear their heartbeat
We're all water from different rivers
That's why it's so easy to meet
We're all water in this vast, vast ocean
Someday we'll evaporate together
There may be not much difference
Between Eldridge Cleaver and Queen of England
We bottle their tears
There may be not much difference
Between Manson and the Pope
We press their smile
There may be not much difference
Between Rockefeller and you
We hear you sing
There may not be much difference
Between you and me
We show our dreams
Hey! There's no difference!
What's the difference? What's the difference?
What? What?
There's no difference! There's no difference!
What's the difference?Temperature's rising
Fever is high
Can't see no future
Can't see no sky
My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a baby
I wish I was dead
Cold turkey has got me on the run
My body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see no body
Leave me alone
My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm in at the deep freeze
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Thirty-six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
Free me again
Oh, I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Oh, oh, oh, ohSnow -

You better see right through that mother's eyes
Those freaks was right when they said you was dead
The one mistake you made was in your head
Ah, how do you sleep?
Ah, how do you sleep at night?
You live with straights who tell you you was king
Jump when your momma tell you anything
The only thing you done was yesterday
And since you're gone you're just another day
Ah, how do you sleep?
Ah, how do you sleep at night?
Ah, how do you sleep?
Ah, how do you sleep at night?
A pretty face may last a year or two
But pretty soon they'll see what you can do
The sound you make is muzak to my ears
You must have learned something in all those years
Ah, how do you sleep?
Ah, how do you sleep at night?How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing?
How can I go forward when I don't know which way to turn?
How can I go forward into something I'm not sure of?
Oh no, oh no
How can I have feeling when I don't know if it's a feeling?
How can I feel something if I just don't know how to feel?
How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied?
Oh no, oh no
You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough
How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving?
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give?
How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had?
Oh no, oh no
You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world, she is tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough
How can we go forward when we don't know which way we're facing?
How can we go forward when we don't know which way to turn?
How can we go forward into something we're not sure of?
Oh no, oh noIn the middle of the night

Pushing the barrier, planting seed
Playing the mind guerilla
Chanting the mantra, "peace on Earth"
We all been playing those mind games forever
Some kind of Druid dude, lifting the veil
Doing the mind guerilla
Some call it magic, the search for the grail
Love is the answer
And you know that, for sure
Love is the flower
You gotta let it, you gotta let it grow
So keep on playing those mind games together
Faith in the future, out of the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerillas
Absolute elsewhere, in the stones of your mind
Yeah, we're playing those mind games forever
Projecting our images in space and in time
Yes is the answer
And you know that for sure
Yes is surrender
You gotta let it, you gotta let it go
So keep on playing those mind games together
Doing the ritual, dance in the sun
Millions of mind guerillas
Putting their soul power to the karmic wheel
Keep on playing those mind games forever
Raising the spirit of peace and love
Love!
Love!
I want you to make love, not war
I know you've heard it beforeWell just as tight as you can make it
Hard and slow ain't hard enough
Just as tight as you can shake it girl
Get it on and do your stuff
Tight as you can get it
Tight as got it made
Uptight's alright, but if you can't stand the heat
You'd better get back in the shade
Just as tight as an Indian rope trick
Long and tough ain't hard enough
Just as tight as a dope fiend's fix, my friend
Get it up and do your stuff
Tight as you can boogie
Tight as got it made

And when I hurt you and cause you pain
Darling I promise I won't do it again
Aisumasen, aisumasen Yoko
It's hard enough I know just to feel your own pain
It's hard enough I know to feel, feel your own pain
All that I know is just what you tell me

And I don't know what to do
Aisumasen, aisumasen  Yoko san
All I had to do was call your name
Yes, all I had to do was call your nameYou are my weakness, you are my strength
Nothing I have in the world makes better sense
'Cause I'm a fish and you're the sea
When we're together or when we're apart
There's never a space in between the beat of our hearts
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree
One day at a time is all we do
One day at a time is good for you
You are my woman, I am your man
Nothing else matters at all, now I understand
That I'm the door and you're the key
And every morning I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face and the love in your eyes
'Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee
One day at a time is all we do
One day at a time is good for you
'Cause I'm a fish and you're the sea
'Cause I'm an apple and you're the tree
'Cause I'm a door and you're the key
'Cause you're the honey and I'm the beeAll right boys, this is it!
Over the hill
We don't care what flag you're waving
We don't even want to know your name
We don't care where you're from or where you're going
All we know is that you came
You're making all our decisions
We have just one request of you
That while you're thinking things over
Here's something you just better do
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now (do it, do it, do it)
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Well, we were caught with our hands in the air
Don't despair, paranoia is everywhere
We can shake it with love when we're scared
So let's shout it aloud like a prayer
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now (do it, do it, do it)
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
We understand your paranoia
But we don't want to play your game
You think you're cool and know what you are doing
666 is your name
So while you're jerking off each other
You better bear this thought in mind
Your time is up, you better know it
But maybe you don't read the signs
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now (do it, do it, do it, do it)
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Well, you were caught with your hands in the kill
And you still got to swallow your pill
As you slip and you slide down the hill
On the blood of the people you killed
Stop the killing now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now (do it, do it, do it)
Stop the killing now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now (do it, do it, do it, do it)
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now (do it, do it, do it, do it)
Free the people now (do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it nowMy intentions are good, I use my intuition
It takes me for a ride
But I never understood other people's superstitions
It seemed like suicide
As I play the game of life
I try to make it better each and every day
And when I struggle in the night
The magic of the music seems to light the way
Ah, intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me everywhere
Well my instincts are fine
I had to learn to use them in order to survive
And time af
Ter time confirmed an old suspicion
It's good to be alive
And when I'm deep down and out and lose communication
With nothing left to say
It's then I realize it's only a condition
Of seeing things that way
Ah, intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me anywhere
Takes me anywhere, alright
Ah, intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me thereOut the blue, you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue, you came to me
Every day, I thank the Lord and Lady
For the way that you came to me
Anyway it had to be two minds
One destiny
Out the blue, you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue, you came to me
All my life has been a long slow knife
I was born just to get to you
Anyway I survived long enough to make you my wife
Out the blue, you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy
Out the blue, you came to me
Like a U.F.O., you came to me
And blew away life's misery
Out the blue, life's energy

One thing I've understood
I am only learning
To tell the trees from wood
I know what's coming down
And I know where it's coming from
And I know and I'm sorry, yes I am
But I never could speak my mind
And I know just how you feel
And I know now what I have done
And I know, and I'm guilty, yes I am
But I never could read your mind
I know what I was missing
But now my eyes can see
I put myself in your place
As you did for me
Today, I love you more than yesterday
Right now, I love you more right now
I know what's coming down
I can feel where it's coming from
And I know it's getting better all the time
As we share in each other's mind
Today I love you more than yesterday
Right now I love you more right now
Ooh hoo, no more crying
Ooh hoo, no more crying

It was a custom made, it was a Flight DeVille
With a powerful motor and a hide away wing
Push in on the button, you will hear her sing
Now you can't catch me
Baby, you can't catch me
Because if you get too close
You know I'm gone like a cool breeze
Hey, hey
Well, you walk
Do the walk
New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours
I was rolling slowly because of drizzling showers
Here comes a flat-top, he was moving up with me
Then come waving goodbye in a little old souped up jitney
I put my foot in the tank, I began to roll
Moaning siren, it was the state patrol
I let out my wings, then I blew my horn
Bye-bye, New Jersey, I become air borne
You can't catch me
Baby, you can't catch me
Because if you get too close
You know I'm gone like a cool breeze

Sweetest little thing that I ever seen

RockAh, remember this
Why, I must have been thirteen when this came out
Or was it fourteen, or was it twenty-two
I could have been twelve actually
Just because you left and said goodbye
Do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so
Darling, I would rather let you go
Just because I want someone who's kind
With a heart as good and pure as mine
But maybe I am asking far too much
Darling, please don't ever break my heart
I know you think you're smart
Just running around and breaking lovers' hearts
Just because you left and said goodbye
Do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so
Darling, I would rather let you go
It’s too late darling, you just gotta say goodbye
Why, the last time I saw you, you were wearing man’s clothes
Not that I’m prejudiced, but you know
I had problems with the zippers
But who am I to hassle you like this?
I’m just gonna have to let you go
There’s two basses in this, I hope you appreciate it
This is Dr. Winston O' Boogie saying goodnight
From Record Plant East, New York
We hope you had a swell time
Everybody here says "Hi" ... goodbye
Just because you left and said goodbye
Do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so
Darling, I would rather let you go
Goodbye, so long
Been a long year

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone
It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over
Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, darling
It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over
Look out
Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere...
Starting overKiss, Kiss, Kiss, Kiss me love
Just one kiss, kiss will do
Kiss, kiss kiss, kiss me love
Just one kiss, kiss will do
Why death
Why Life
Warm hearts
Cold darts
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love
I'm bleeding inside
It's a long, long story to tell
And I can only show you my hell
Touch, touch, touch, touch me love
Just one touch, touch will do
Touch, touch, touch, touch me love
Just one touch, touch will do
Why me

Broken mirror
White terror
Touch, touch, touch, touch me love

It's that faint, faint sound of the childhood bell
Ringing in my soul
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love
Just one kiss, kiss will doBubble, bubble...
Moonlight on the water
Sun light on my face
You and me together
We are in our place
The gods are in the heavens
The angels treat us well
The oracle has spoken
We cast the perfect spell
The queen is in the counting house
Counting out the money
The king is in the kitchen
Making bread and honey
No friends and yet no enemies
Absolutely free
No rats aboard the magic ship
Of perfect harmony
Now it begins - let it begin
Cleanup time, hey
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Well, well, well
(Show those mothers how to do it)
However, far we travel
Wherever we may roam
The centre of the circle
Will always be our home
Yeah yeah
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup timeThe food is cold
Your eyes are cold
The window's cold
The bed is cold
Give me something that's not cold
Come on, come on
Give me something that's not cold
Come on, come on
Give me something that's not cold
Come on, come on
The chair is hard
Your voice is hard
The money's hard
The living's hard
Give me something that's not hard
Come on, come on
Give me something that's not hard
Come on, come on
Give me something that's not hard
Come on, come on
Give me, give me
And I'll give you a heartbeat
And a bit of tear and flesh
It's not very much but while it's there
You can have it, you can have itHere in some stranger's room
Late in the afternoon
What am I doing here at all?
Ain't no doubt about it
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Somehow the wires have crossed
Communication's lost
Can't even get you on the telephone
Just got to shout about it
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Here in the valley of indecision
I don't know what to do
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Well now you say you're not getting enough
But I remind you of all that bad, bad, bad stuff
So what the hell am I supposed to do?
Just put a Band-Aid on it?
And stop the bleeding now
Stop the bleeding now
Well
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Well, well, well, I know I hurt you then
But hell that was way back when
Well, do you still have to carry that cross?
Don't want to hear about it
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Don't want to lose you now
Well, well
Don't, don't, don'tSave your sweet talk for when you score
Keep your Monday kisses for your glass lady
I want the truth and nothing more
I'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony
You didn't have to tell a white lie
You know you scored me for life
Don't stick your fingers in my pie
You know I'll see through your jive
I want the truth and nothing more
When you were angry you had love in your eyes
When you were sad you had a dream in your voice
But now your giving me your window smile
Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone, he's on the run
And your daddy's here
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Out on the ocean sailing away
I can hardly wait
To see you to come of age
But I guess we'll both
Just have to be patient
'Cause it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
Yes it's a long way to go
But in the meantime
Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you
While you're busy making other plans
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Darling, darling, darling
Darling Sean
Goodnight Sean
See you in the morning
Bright and earlyPeople say I'm crazy doing what I'm doing
Well they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin
When I say that I'm okay well they look at me kind of strange
Surely you're not happy now you no longer play the game
People say I'm lazy dreaming my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
When I tell 'em that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time boy? You're no longer on the ball
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go
People asking questions lost in confusion
Well I tell them there's no problem
Only solutions
Well they shake their heads and they look at me
As if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry
I'm just sitting here doing time
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it goYes, I'm your angel
I'll give you everything
In my magic power
So make a wish
And I'll let it come true for you
Tra, la, la, la
Yes, you're my fairy
You give me everything
I ever wanted from life
Have I made a wish
And is that why I have you
Tra, la, la, la
We believe in pumpkins that
Turn into princesses
And frogs that turn into princes
We believe in moons that smile to us
When we hurry home before midnight strikes
Tra, la, la, la
Yes I'm so pretty
You're so dizzy
And we're so happy every day
Let's make a wish
And let it come true for us
I'm in your pocket
You're in my locket
And we're so lucky in every way
We make a wish
And let it come true for us
We believe in houses built in the sky
And love that lifts us high
We believe in sun that looks over our
Shoulders and brings our shadows together
Tra, la, la, la
Yes
Our hearts are one
Our bodies, too
And it's so good (um) everytime
We make a wish
And let it come true for you, too
Tra, la, la, la
Happy birthday, my love
I'm your angel
I'll give you everything
In my magic power
So make a wish
And I'll let it come true for you(For the other half of the sky)

My inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success

Your eyes have seen the world
Though you're only four years old
And your tears are streaming
Even when you're smiling
Please never be afraid to cry
You're a beautiful boy
With all your little ploys
Your mind has changed the world
And you're now forty years old
You got all you can carry
And still somehow empty
Don't ever be afraid to fly
All you beautiful boys
Creating multiple plays
You like to fence in your world
And settle down when you're old
You can run from pole to pole
And never scratch your soul
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back
Don't be afraid to be afraidWella hella hella

The goddess really smiled upon our love dear YokoEvery man has a woman who loves him
In rain or shine or life or death
If he finds her in this lifetime
He will know when he presses his ear to her breast
Why do I roam when I know you're the one?
Why do I laugh when I feel like crying?
Every woman has a man who loves her
Rise or fall of her life and death
If she finds him in this lifetime
She will know when she looks into his eyes
Why do I roam when I know you're the one?
Why do I run when I feel like holding you?
Every man has a woman who loves him
If he finds her in this lifetime
He will knowIt's been very hard

You don't have to worry
In heaven or hell
Just dance to the music
You do it so well, well, well!
Hatred and jealousy, gonna be the death of me
I guess I knew it right from the start
Sing out about love and peace
Don't want to see the red raw meat
The green eyed goddamn straight from your heart
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of being so alone
No place to call my own
Like a rollin' stone
Baby!
So long ago
Was it in a dream, was it just a dream?
I know, yes I know
Seemed so very real, it seemed so real to me
Took a walk down the street
Through the heat whispered trees
I thought I could hear, hear
Hear, hear
Somebody call out my name (John)
As it started to rain (John)
Two spirits dancing so strange
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Dream, dream away
Magic in the air, was magic in the air?
I believe, yes I believe
More I cannot say, what more can I say?
On a river of sound
Through the mirror go around, around
I thought I could feel, feel
Feel, feel
Music touching my soul (nhoJ)
Something warm, sudden cold (nhoJ)
The spirit dance was unfolding
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, poussé
Ah! böwakawa poussé, pousséHey!
Sweet as the smell of success
Her body's warm and wet
She gets me through this god awful lonliness
A natural high, butterfly
Oh I need, need, need her
Just like a willow tree
A breath of spring you see
And oh boy you don't know what she do to me
She makes me sweat and forget who I am
Oh, I, I need, need, need, need, need her
Well, I was wondering how long this could go on, on and on
Well, I thought I could never be surprised
But could it be that I bit my own tongue?
Oh yeah, it's so hard to swallow when you're wrong
A bird of paradise
The sunrise in her eyes
God only knows such a sweet surprise
I was blind, she blew my mind, think that I
I love, love, love, love, love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love
Ah yeah
Ah yeahThis is a story about your friend and mine
Who is it, who is it, who is it?
There you stand with your L.A. tan
And your New York walk and your New York talk
Your mother left you when you were small
But you're going to wish you wasn't born at all
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Your phone don't ring, no one answers your call
How does it feel to be off the wall
Well, your mouthpiece squawks as he spreads your lies
But you can't pull strings if your hands are tied
Well, your teeth are clean but your mind is capped
You leave your smell like an alley cat
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Steel and glassBeef Jerky, beef jerky, beef jerky, beef jerky
Beef, beef, beef, beefNobody loves you when you're down and out
Nobody sees you when you're on cloud nine
Everybody's hustling for a buck and a dime
I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine
I've been across to the other side
I've shown you everything, I got nothing to hide
And still you ask me, "Do I love you?"
What it is, what it is
All I can tell you is, it's all show biz
All I can tell you is, it's all show biz
Nobody loves you when you're down and out
Nobody knows you when you're on cloud nine
Everybody's hustling for a buck and a dime
I'll scratch your back and you knife mine
I've been across the water now so many times
I've seen the one eyed witch doctor leading the blind
And still you ask me, "Do I love you?"
What you say, what you say
Every time I put my finger on it, it slips away
Every time I put my finger on it, it slips away
Well I get up in the morning and I'm looking in the mirror to see
Ooo wee!
Then I'm lying in the darkness and I know I can't get to sleep
Ooo wee!
Nobody loves you when you're old and grey
Nobody needs you when you're upside down
Everybody's hollering about their own birthday
Everybody loves you when you're six foot in the groundOkay, we'll do "Sitting in the La La"
That'll get rid of that
1, 2, 3, 4
Sitting in the la la

This here is the story about a househusband who, you know, just has to get out of the house. He's been looking at the, you know, the kids for days and days; he's been watching the kitchen and screwing around watching Sesame Street till he's going crazy!
Woke up this morning blues around my head
No need to ask the reason why
Went to the kitchen and lit a cigarette
Blew my worries to the sky
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
If it don't feel right you don't have to do it
Just leave a message on the phone and tell them to screw it
After all is said and done, you can't go pleasing everyone
So screw it
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
Baby's sleeping, the cats have all been blessed
Ain't nothing doing on TV (Summer repeats)
Put on my space suit I got to look my best
I'm going out to do the city
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out baby
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out, hold it down
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get out
I'm stepping out, babe, just for awhile
Ain't been out for days
Got to do it tonight
Gimme a break, gimme a break
Gotta get out
Gotta get out
Just for awhile
Just for the night
I'll be in before oneSleepless night
The moon is bright
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love
Legs
What am I going to do with my legs
They're so hot
They won't stay on the cot
And they're screaming!
Sleepless night
The moon is bright
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love
Head
What am I going to do with my head
It's so light
It just gives me the fright
It's full of champagne and dreams
Sleepless night
All um umm
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love
This brush must sell like crazy
I mean there's a lot of lonely people out there
I wanna go to the ball
I wanna give it all
I'll take it all
Sleepless night
All I'm asking for is...
What am I asking for?Un ... deux
Ein, zwei, hickle pickle
Say you're looking for a place to go
Where nobody knows your name
You're looking for oblivion
With one eye on the Hall of Fame
I don't want to face it, oh no
I don't want to face it, no no no no
Well, I can dish it out
But I just can't take it
Say you're looking for some peace and love
Leader of a big old band
You want to save humanity
But it's people that you just can't stand
I don't want to face it oh no
I don't want to face it no, no, no, no
Well, I can sing for my supper
But I just can't make it
Well, now you're looking for a world of truth
Trying to find a better way
The time has come to see yourself
You always look the other way
I don't want to face it, no no
I don't want to face it, no no no no
Well, I can see the promised land
And I know I can make it
I don't want to face it, I know
I don't want to face it, oh no
I don't want to face it, oh no
I don't want to face it
Ow, I don't want to face it
I just can't face it no more
Every time I look in the mirror
I don't see anybody there, wooDon't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared to love
Better to love than never love at all
Don't be scared
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Don't be shy to tell
You may lose the chance to tell
Don't be shy
When your hearts are lit
Drop your survival kit
Then you never have to
Run or split
Sun in the east
Moon in the west
This boat's moving slow
There's no land in sight at all
Away we go
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared to love
It's better to love than never love at all
Don't be scared...Three, Four!
Everybody's talking and no one says a word
Everybody's making love and no one really cares
There's matches in the bathroom just below the stairs
Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China so finish what you've got
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Strange days indeed
Everybody's running and no one makes a move
Everybody's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu
Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies, you just gotta lay around
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar mama
Everybody's smoking and no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's UFOs over New York and I ain't too surprised
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar mama, roll!Mm, dum, doo, dum
Mm, dum, doo, da-da, dum
It's only sane to be insane
Psychotic builds a castle and neurotic lives in it
I don't know what to do with my sanity
When the world's at a verge of calamity
O' sanity, o' sanity
What am I to do with you?
Drink up, shoot up, anything you please
But she's always standing behind me like a devil in hell
O' sanity, o' sanity
Why don't you let me go?
Let go, let go
Cut it out!When I was younger, uh huh
Living confusion and deep despair
When I was younger, uh huh
Living illusion of freedom and power
When I was younger
Full of ideals and broken dreams, my friend
When I was younger, uh huh
Everything simple but not so clear
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Now I am older
The more that I see the less that I know for sure
Now I am older, uh huh
The future is brighter and now is the hour
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Good to be older
Would not exchange a single day or a year
Good to be older, uh huh (You bet)
Less complication everything clear
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Oh yes
It all seemed so bloody easy then
You know like
What to wear very serious like you know
How am I gonna get rid of the pimples
Does she really love me
All that crap
But now I don't bother about that shit no more
I know she loves me
All I gotta bother about is standing up
Alright you can get out of thereAnatano te, konnani kireina

The rest of our life is the, my little
I'm homeLet me count the ways how I love you
It's like that gentle wind you feel at dawn
It's like that first sun that hits the dew
It's like that cloud with a gold lining telling us softly
That it'll be a good day, a good day for us
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Let me count the ways how I miss you
It's like that oak tree in my childhood garden
It's like that first summer I spent in Egypt
It's like that warm evening you read to me
Both knowing deeply that it's a good time, a good time for us
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Let me count the ways how I see you
It's like that lake in the mountain you heard about
It's like that autumn sky that stays so blue
It's like that air around me that holds me gently
Whispering strongly that you're always there, always for me
Thank you, thank you, thank youGrow old along with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one
God bless our love

Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the setting Sun
When the day is done
God bless our love

Spending our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end

Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through

But you make me free myself
You make me free
How do I tell you

You're the one
You're the one
In the world's eye
We were Laurel and Hardy
In our minds
We were Heathcliff and Cathy
In a moment of wisdom
We were a wizard and a witch
In a moment of freedom
We were Don Quijote and Sancho
In reality
We were just a boy and a girl
Who never looked back
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How can I tell you
How could I tell you
You're the one

You're the one
You're the one...Every man has a woman who loves him
Rain or shine or life or death
If he finds her in this lifetime
He will know when he presses his ear to her breast
Why do I roam when I know you're the one?
Why do I laugh when I feel like crying?
Every woman has a man who loves her
Rise or fall of her life and in death
If she finds him in this lifetime
She will know when she looks into his eyes
Why do I roam when I know you're the one?
Why do I run when I feel like holding you?
Every man has a woman who loves him
If he finds her in this lifetime
He will knowMother, you had me but I never had you
I wanted you, you didn't want me
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
Father, you left me but I never left you
I needed you, you didn't need me
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
Children, don't do what I have done
I couldn't walk and I tried to run
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

Now that I showed you what I been through
Don't take nobody's word what you can do
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky
Now that I found out I know I can cry
I, I found out!
I, I found out!
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand
Don't get you nowhere, don't make you a man
I heard something about my Ma and my Pa
They didn't want me so they made me a star
I, I found out!
I, I found out!
Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do
Keep you occupied with pie in the sky
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes
I, I found out!
I, I found out!
I seen through junkies, I been through it all
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine
No one can harm you, feel your own pain
I, I found out!
I, I found this out!
I, I found out!As soon as you're born, they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home, and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever, and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy, you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow mePeople say we've got it made
Don't they know we're so afraid?
Isolation
We're afraid to be alone
Everybody got to have a home
Isolation
Just a boy and a little girl
Tryin' to change the whole wide world
Isolation
The world is just a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
I-Isolation
I don't expect you to understand
After you've caused so much pain
But then again, you're not to blame
You're just a human, a victim of the insane
We're afraid of everyone
Afraid of the sun
Isolation
The sun will never disappear
But the world may not have many years
I-IsolationRemember when you were young
How the hero was never hung
Always got away
Remember how the man
Used to leave you empty handed
Always, always let you down
If you ever change your mind
About leaving it all behind
Remember, remember today
Hey hey
Don't feel sorry
The way it's gone
And don't you worry
About what you've done
Just remember
When you were small
How people seemed so tall
Always had their way
Hey hey
Do you remember your ma and pa
Just wishing for movie stardom
Always, always playing a part
If you ever feel so sad
And the whole world is driving you mad
Remember, remember today
Hey hey
Don't feel sorry
About the way it's gone
Don't you worry
About what you've done

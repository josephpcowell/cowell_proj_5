(Yeah, yeah!)\nThis man is bound to lose his ship and his crew\n\n[Verse 3]\nDespite repeated warnings\nFrom those who ought to know\nWell, he's got his own agenda\nAnd so he'll go\n\n[Bridge 2]\n(What can we do?)\nThose who shout the loudest (What can we do?)\nMay not always be the smartest (What can we do?)\nBut they have their proudest moments\nRight before they fall\n(What can we do?)\nRed sky in the morning (What can we do?)\nDoesn't ever seem to faze him (What can we do?)\nBut a sailor's warning signal\nShould concern us all, whoa-oh\n\nPart II\n[Chorus]\nHow can we stop him?\nGrab the keys and lock him up\nIf we can do it\nWe can save the day\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe engineer lives with his wife and daughter, Janet\nBut he misses them so\nAlthough he's working with the best crew on the planet (We're the best crew on the planet!)\nThey never want him to go\n\nHe had a premonition\nHe senses something's wrong\nAnd by his own admission\nHe knew it all along\n\nThe captain's crazy\nBut he doesn't let them know it\nHe'll take us with him\nIf we don't do something soon to slow it\n\n[Chorus]\nHow can we stop him?\nGrab the keys and lock him up\nIf we can do it\nWe can save the day\n\n[Bridge]\nBelow decks, the engineer cries\nThe captain's gonna leave us when the temperatures rise\nThe needle's going up, the engine's gonna blow\nAnd we are gonna be left down below\nDown below\n\nPart III\n[Instrumental Intro]\n\n[Chorus]\nYes we can do it\nYeah, we can do it now\nYes we can do it\n\n[Instrumental interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nYes, we can do it\nYeah, we can do it now\nYes, we can do it\nYeah, we can do it now\nYes, we can do it\nYeah, we can do it now\nOh yeah\n\n[Verse]\nIf life would work out the way you plan it\nThat'd be so fine for the wife and Janet\nSometimes you might have to battle through it\nAnd that's the way you learn how you've got to do it\n\n[Bridge]\nYes, we can do it, whoa-oh\nYes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa\nYes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa\nYes, we can do it, whoa-oh-whoa\n\nPart I reprise\n[Verse 1]\nDespite repeated warnings\nOf dangers up ahead\nWell, the captain wasn't listening\nTo what was said\n\n[Outro]\nSo we went to the captain (What can we do? / For those who shout the loudest)\nAnd we told him to turn around (What can we do? / May not always be the smartest)\nBut he laughs in our faces (What can we do? / But they have their proudest moments)\nSays that we are mistaken (Right before they fall)\nSo we gather around him (What can we do? / Red sky in the morning)\nNow the ropes that have bound him (What can we do? / Doesn't ever seem to faze him)\nProve that he should have listened (What can we do? / But a sailor's warning signal) (Should concern us all)\nTo the will of the people\nIt's the will of the people\nIt's the will of the people"

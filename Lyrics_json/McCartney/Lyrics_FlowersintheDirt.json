Note meant for you\nAs I clear away another untouched TV dinner\nFrom the table I laid for two\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow that I'm alone again\nI can't stop breaking down again\nThe simplest things set me off again\nTake me to that place\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere I can't find my brave face\nWhere I can't find my brave face\nMy brave, my brave, my brave face\n\n[Outro]\nMy brave face"

   "lyrics": "[Chorus 1]\nTo me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day\nYou can't take that away\nNo, you can't take that away\nAll my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way\nThat was up until today\nOh it had to be this way\n\n[Chorus 2]\nToday, wait until the morning comes\nBefore you slip away\nWithout permission\nWithout suspicion\nWithout permission given\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou seem to have a friendlier smile than all the rest\nWell I looked and you were best\nYeah I've looked at all the rest\nYou can't imagine passionate words that I would say\nIf only you would stay\nOh you know you got to stay\n\n[Chorus 2]\nToday, wait until the morning comes\nBefore you slip away\nWithout permission\nWithout suspicion\nWithout permission given\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou used to be and early bird\nBut how was I to know you would leave without shedding a tear\nI only want to love you\nI'll make a wish and suddenly I'm glad that I have you here\nOh I'm glad I have you here\nToday\n\n[Chorus 1]\nTo me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day\nYou can't take that away\nNo, you can't take that away\nAll my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way\nThat was up until today\nOh it had to be this way\n\n[Chorus 2]\nToday, wait until the morning comes\nBefore you slip away\nWithout permission\nWithout suspicion\nWithout permission given"

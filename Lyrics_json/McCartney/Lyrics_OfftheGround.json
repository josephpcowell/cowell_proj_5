I felt so good\nAt the centre of a love vibration\nPeople caring for their world\nHelping each other out\nPeace in the neighbourhood\nHelping each other out\nPeace in the neighbourhood\nHelping each other out\n\n[Outro]\nBest thing I ever saw\nI saw a man who loved his wife\nPeace in the neighbourhood\nHelping each other out\nPeace in the neighbourhood"

Can you hear me?\n\nStop\nYou know when you're accident prone\nNobody likes you\nWave to a man in a rolls\n'Cause he knows how to live, ha! Ha\n\nStop and take the time to stop that smoking\nStop, before the light turns green\nYou won't be blue\nStop, in the name of the law\n\n\"well, i was walking down the street the other day\nYou know, and i said to myself, what's all this hurry\nWhat's all this hustle and bustle\nWhy don't i just stop, look at the pretty roses\nSmell them for one moment, take the time to see\nTake the time to smell, have a good time in life\nDon't let everything pass you by, you're only here once\nAnd I've been here longer than most of you\n\nSo stop and take the time to buy this album\nSo i can plant roses and smell them all day long\nStop everything you're doing\nRun to your local record shop and say\n\"give me that record called 'stop\nI'm going crazy with this record business\nI want to stop it, you want me to stop it\nEverybody wants it to stop"

   "lyrics": "[Verse]\nOne, two, three, four\n\nStop and take the time to smell the roses\nI said, stop and take the time to fill your noses\nStop as you stroll through life, (\"pitter patter, pitter patter\nStop and take the time to talk it over with your wife\n\nI said, stop and take the time, take the time to read the label\nStop, you must remember clark and betty grable\nStop, there's no train to catch, no there isn't, rose\nNo, no, no\n\nCome on, everybody, you've got to stop\nStop on the highway\nStop when you're in your car on that highway\nRoll down your window\nLook for a man in a porsche and say\n\"fuck it, brother, let's get out and walk, let's go! Can you hear me?\n\nStop\nStop when you're in your ford cortina\nYou know when you're accident prone\nNobody likes you\nWave to a man in a rolls\n'Cause he knows how to live, ha! Ha\n\nWell, i said, stop and take the time to stop that smoking\nStop, there's no train to catch\nYou won't be blue\nYou, you, you\n\n\"well, i was walking down the street the other day\nYou know, and i said to myself, what's all this hurry\nWhat's all this hustle and bustle\nWhy don't i just stop, look at the pretty roses\nSmell them for one moment, take the time to see\nTake the time to smell, have a good time in life\nDon't let everything pass you by, you're only here once\nAnd I've been here longer than most of you\n\nSo stop and take the time to buy this album\nSo i can plant roses and smell them all day long\nStop everything you're doing\nRun to your local record shop and say\n\"give me that record called 'stop\nI'm going crazy with this record business\nI want to stop it, you want me to stop it\nEverybody wants it to stop\n\n[Outro]\nWell, i'm leaving you now\n'Cause i just got to stop\nI'm going to stop it now"

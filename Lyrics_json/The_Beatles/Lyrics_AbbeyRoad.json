Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon her head\n(Do-do-do-do)\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that she was dead\n(Do-do-do-do)\n\n[Verse 3]\nP. C. 31 said, \"We caught a dirty one,\"\nMaxwell stands alone\nPainting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh\nRose and Valerie, \nScreaming from the gallery, say he must go free\n(Maxwell must go free)\nThe judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o\nBut as the words are leaving his lips\nA noise comes from behind\n\n[Chorus]\nBang!

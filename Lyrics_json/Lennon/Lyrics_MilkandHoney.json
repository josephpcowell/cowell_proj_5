He's been looking at the, you know, the kids for days and days; he's been watching the kitchen and screwing around watching Sesame Street till he's going crazy!\n\n[Verse 1]\nWoke up this morning blues around my head\nNo need to ask the reason why\nWent to the kitchen and lit a cigarette\nBlew my worries to the sky\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf it don't feel right you don't have to do it\nJust leave a message on the phone and tell them to screw it\nAfter all is said and done, you can't go pleasing everyone\nSo screw it\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaby's sleeping, the cats have all been blessed\nAin't nothing doing on TV (Summer repeats)\nPut on my space suit I got to look my best\nI'm going out to do the city\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out baby\nI'm stepping out\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Outro]\nI'm stepping out, hold it down\nI'm stepping out\nI'm stepping out\nGotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get out\nI'm stepping out, babe, just for awhile\nAin't been out for days\nGot to do it tonight\nGimme a break, gimme a break\nGotta get out\nGotta get out\nJust for awhile\nJust for the night\nI'll be in before one"

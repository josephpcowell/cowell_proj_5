   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's been very hard\nBut it's getting easier now\nHard times are over, over for a while\nThe leaves are shining in the sun\nAnd smiling inside\nYou and I watching each other on a street corner\nCars and buses and planes and people go by\n\n[Bridge]\nBut we don't care\nWe want to know\nWe want to know in each other's eyes\nThat hard times are over, over for some time\n\n[Chorus]\nHard times are over\nHard times are over\nHard times are over, over for a while\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's been very rough\nBut it's getting easier now\nHard times are over, over for a while\nThe streams are twinkling in the sun\nAnd I'm smiling inside\nYou and I walking together around the street corner\n\n[Chorus]\nHard times are over\nHard times are over\nHard times are over, over for a while"
